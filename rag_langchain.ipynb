Three different viruses are known to cause large Ebola disease outbreaks: Ebola virus, Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus.The average Ebola disease case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks. Early intensive supportive care with rehydration and the treatment of symptoms improves survival.Approved vaccines and treatments are only available for one of the viruses (Ebola virus) and are under development for the others. Outbreak control relies on a package of interventions including intensive supportive care of patients, infection prevention and control, disease surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, safe and dignified burials, vaccination if relevant, and social mobilization.OverviewEbola disease (EBOD) is a rare but severe illness in humans (1). It is often fatal. Ebola disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Orthoebolavirus genus of the filoviridae family (2). Six species of Orthoebolaviruses have been identified to date, with three known to cause large outbreaks:Ebola virus (EBOV) causing Ebola virus disease (EVD)Sudan virus (SUDV) causing Sudan virus disease (SVD)Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) causing Bundibugyo virus disease (BVD). \\xa0Ebola disease first occurred in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks: one outbreak was of Sudan virus disease in Nzara in what is now South Sudan, and the other outbreak was of Ebola virus disease in Yambuku, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.While there are licensed vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD. Candidate products are in development. Early intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival. Seeking early care can be lifesaving. TransmissionIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural hosts of the Orthoebolavirus. The virus can get into the human population when people have close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.People can get infected with the virus from another person by direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with:the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease; andobjects or surfaces that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, feces, vomit) from a person sick with the disease or who has died from the disease.People cannot transmit the disease before they have symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus.Health and care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with Ebola disease. This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of a person who has died can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola disease.SymptomsThe incubation period or interval from infection to onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 21 days.The symptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, malaise, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver functions. It is important for health and care workers to be on the lookout for these symptoms. Despite a perception that bleeding is a common symptom, this is less frequent and can occur later in the disease. Some patients may develop internal and external bleeding, including blood in vomit and faeces, bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. Bleeding at the sites where needles have punctured the skin can also occur. The impact on the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability and aggression.DiagnosisIt can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola disease from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers because symptoms at early stage of the disease are similar. Confirmation that the person has an Orthoebolavirus infection is made using the following diagnostic methods:reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assayantibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)antigen-capture detection testsvirus isolation by cell culture.Samples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. All non-inactivated biological specimens should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported nationally and internationally See Diagnostic testing for Ebola and Marburg diseases.Treatment Over the years, WHO and partners have developed guidance and training that outline how to provide the best possible care for patients and increase their chance of survival, whether or not specific treatments are being used. Called optimized supportive care, this covers the relevant tests to administer, how to manage pain, nutrition and co-infections (such as malaria), and other approaches that put the patient on the best path to recovery.For Ebola virus disease, WHO made strong recommendations for treatment with mAb114 (ansuvimabTM) or REGN-EB3 (InmazebTM) that are both monoclonal antibodies. For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD, there are no approved therapeutics, but candidate products are under development and a CORE protocol for clinical trials is available. VaccinesFor Ebola virus disease: Two vaccines are approved: Ervebo (Merck & Co.) and Zabdeno and Mvabea (Janssen Pharmaceutica). Ervebo vaccine is recommended as part of outbreak response, see SAGE recommendations of July 2024.In case of a confirmed Ebola virus disease outbreak, Ervebo vaccines can be accessed through the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision.For preventive vaccination of health-care and frontline workers, request of Ervebo vaccines can be made through Gavi Preventive Ebola vaccination.For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD:Several candidate vaccines are at different stages of development. As part of outbreak response, a CORE protocol to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccine candidates is available. Prevention and controlCommunity engagement is key to successfully controlling any outbreak. Outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as clinical care, surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, infection prevention and control in health facilities, safe and dignified burials, vaccination (only for Ebola virus disease) and social mobilization. Raising awareness of risk factors and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors:Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat.Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission arising from direct or close contact with infected people, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided. Patients should be isolated in a designated treatment center for early care and to avoid transmission at home. Communities should be well informed, both about the disease itself and how to control the outbreak. This is done best when they are involved in the response and there is open discussion.Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased, identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Ebola disease and monitoring their health for 21 days, separating the healthy from the sick to prevent further spread and providing care to confirmed patients. Maintaining good hygiene and a clean environment are also important.Controlling infection in health-care settingsHealth-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe and dignified burial practices.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola disease should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patients’ blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg diseases. Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Orthoebolavirus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.Care for survivors All survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect, dignity and compassion. WHO does not recommend isolation of recovered patients whose blood has tested negative for Orthoebolavirus. Survivors might suffer from both clinical and psychological sequelae. WHO encourages affected countries to consider the establishment of care programme to alleviate sequelae, support to community reintegration, counselling and biological testing. Orthoebolaviruses are known to persist in immune-privileged sites in some people who have recovered. These sites include the testicles, the inside of the eye and the brain. Relapse-symptomatic illness in the absence of re-infection in someone who has recovered from Ebola disease is rare but has been documented. Reasons for this phenomenon are not yet fully understood.Ebola virus transmission via infected semen has been documented up to fifteen months after clinical recovery. To mitigate the risk of this transmission, a semen testing programme should be implemented to: offer counselling to male survivors and their sexual partners to inform them of the potential risk and support them adhering to safer sex practices (including condom provision and good hand and personal hygiene); offer monthly semen testing until they have had two consecutive negative test results; and after two consecutive negative tests, survivors can safely resume normal sexual practices with minimized risk of virus transmission. In the absence of a semen testing programme, male survivors should follow safer sex practices for 12 months. Orthoebolavirus may persist in the placenta, amniotic fluid and fetus of women infected while pregnant, and in the breast milk of breastfeeding women who are infected with the virus. Survivor care programmes should encompass care for pregnant and breastfeeding women after their recovery.\\xa0\\xa0 WHO responseWHO works with countries to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance and supporting at-risk countries to develop preparedness plans. The following document provides overall guidance for control of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks:  Ebola and Marburg virus disease epidemics: preparedness, alert, control, and evaluationWhen an outbreak is detected, WHO responds by supporting outbreak response, disease detection, community engagement, contact tracing, vaccination, vaccine and treatment trials, case management, laboratory services, infection control, logistics, and training and assistance with safe and dignified burial practices.\\xa0ReferencesInternational Classification of Disease, ICD-11, 2024\\xa0: International Classification of Diseases (ICD)International Committee on Virus Taxonomy, ICTV\\xa0: https://ictv.global/report/chapter/filoviridae/filoviridae/orthoebolavirus\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\nDisease outbreak newsWHO's work on Ebola disease\\nNews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaying tribute to David Nabarro\\n30 July 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO Launches Online Training to Strengthen Filovirus Outbreak Response\\n26 March 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGroundbreaking Ebola vaccination trial launches today in Uganda\\n3 February 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature stories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonors making a difference: community engagement to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all\\n28 February 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonors making a difference: United against mpox, swift and effective response in action\\n25 September 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonors making a difference: Climate change and its impact on health\\n9 November 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore\\nFAQs on Ebola virus diseaseFAQs on Ebola vaccinesEbola virus disease outbreak, Guinea: Multi-country strategic readiness and response planHealth Care Readiness: Ebola clinical managementClinical care for survivors of Ebola virus diseaseTherapeutics for Ebola virus diseasePublications on Ebola virus disease\\xa0Ebola outbreak 2022 - Équateur Province, DRC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegions\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\n\\n\\nAmericas\\n\\n\\nEastern Mediterranean\\n\\n\\nEurope\\n\\n\\nSouth-East Asia\\n\\n\\nWestern Pacific\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\nEthics\\n\\n\\nInformation disclosure\\n\\n\\nPermissions and licensing\\n\\n\\nPreventing sexual exploitation\\n\\n\\nTerms of use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\n\\nProcurement\\n\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         \\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\r\\n                                ©\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n                            2025\\r\\n\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nWHO\\n\\n                           \"),\n",

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEbola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates.\\nThe virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.\\nThe average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.\\nThe first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.\\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Symptoms\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.\\nSymptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.\\n It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.\\xa0A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Treatment and prevention\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.\\xa0In the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the  first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial\\xa0was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC.Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus, and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools. In December 2020, the vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and prequalified by WHO for use in individuals 18 years of age and older (except for pregnant and breastfeeding women) for protection against Ebola virus disease caused by Zaïre Ebola virus.\\xa0In May 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended granting marketing authorization for a 2-component vaccine called Zabdeno-and-Mvabea for individuals 1 year and older.\\xa0The vaccine is delivered in 2 doses: Zabdeno is administered first and Mvabea is given approximately 8 weeks later as a second dose.

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEbola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates.\\nThe virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.\\nThe average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.\\nThe first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.\\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Symptoms\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.\\nSymptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.\\n It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.\\xa0A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Treatment and prevention\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.\\xa0In the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the  first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial\\xa0was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC.Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus, and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools. In December 2020, the vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and prequalified by WHO for use in individuals 18 years of age and older (except for pregnant and breastfeeding women) for protection against Ebola virus disease caused by Zaïre Ebola virus.\\xa0In May 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended granting marketing authorization for a 2-component vaccine called Zabdeno-and-Mvabea for individuals 1 year and older.\\xa0The vaccine is delivered in 2 doses: Zabdeno is administered first and Mvabea is given approximately 8 weeks later as a second dose.

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEbola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates.\\nThe virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.\\nThe average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.\\nThe first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.\\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Symptoms\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.\\nSymptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.\\n It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.\\xa0A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Treatment and prevention\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.\\xa0In the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the  first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial\\xa0was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC.Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus, and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools. In December 2020, the vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and prequalified by WHO for use in individuals 18 years of age and older (except for pregnant and breastfeeding women) for protection against Ebola virus disease caused by Zaïre Ebola virus.\\xa0In May 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended granting marketing authorization for a 2-component vaccine called Zabdeno-and-Mvabea for individuals 1 year and older.\\xa0The vaccine is delivered in 2 doses: Zabdeno is administered first and Mvabea is given approximately 8 weeks later as a second dose.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year.\\n\\n\\nThe vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. \\n\\nThe trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners.\\n\\n\"While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa\\'s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,\" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. \\n\\nThe vaccine\\'s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.\\n\\nSince Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. \\n\\nThe trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.\\n\\nWhen a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or \"rings\") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. \\n\\nInitially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.\\n\\nIn addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called \"herd immunity\"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\\n\\n\"Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured,\" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea.\\n\\nTo assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.\\n\\nIt was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.\\n\\n\"This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,\" said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. \\n\\nIn January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300 000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO’s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.\\n\\nAdditional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called “compassionate use” that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO’s partners are working to compile data to support license applications.\\n\\nThe rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO’s R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.\\nNotes to editors\\n\\nThe rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust; the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway,; the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; and Médecins Sans Frontières. \\n\\nThe trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.\\n\\n\\nInterim results of the trial, published in August 2015\\n\\nrVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans.\\n\\nAnalysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia Contacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Tarik Jasarevic\\n\\r\\n                        Spokesperson / Media Relations\\r\\n                            WHO                    \\n\\nTelephone:\\n+41227915099\\n\\n\\nMobile:\\n+41793676214\\n\\n\\nEmail:\\njasarevict@who.int\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature stories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonors making a difference: community engagement to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all\\n28 February 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegions\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\n\\n\\nAmericas\\n\\n\\nEastern Mediterranean\\n\\n\\nEurope\\n\\n\\nSouth-East Asia\\n\\n\\nWestern Pacific\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\nEthics\\n\\n\\nInformation disclosure\\n\\n\\nPermissions and licensing\\n\\n\\nPreventing sexual exploitation\\n\\n\\nTerms of use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\n\\nProcurement\\n\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         \\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\r\\n                                ©\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n                            2025\\r\\n\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nWHO\\n\\n                           '),\n",

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization previously recommended that urgent consideration should be given to evaluating new candidate vaccines in randomised trials among health care and front line workers in high risk areas which are not directly related to a case of Ebola (ie, in areas the outbreak has not reached). As part of these efforts, WHO has been working with several partners to discuss study designs that could help assess the efficacy and effectiveness of available candidate vaccines. In order to determine suitability of Ebola vaccines for clinical studies, WHO reviewed data generated by Ebola vaccine manufacturers on two candidate vaccines: the adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/ MVA-BN) vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson, and the CanSino-Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Ad5-EBOV) vaccine.\\xa0These vaccines were assessed according to a framework developed by the WHO Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee on Ebola Experimental interventions (STAC-EE) in 2015 and previously used to assess other candidate Ebola vaccines. The experts considered a number of criteria to be used in the selection of the vaccine that would be tested in clinical studies and observational studies. As recommended by SAGE in April 2019, proposed studies should be scientifically and epidemiologically justified, and have appropriate approvals including from all relevant African and other regulatory and ethics authorities. Criteria included acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses.\\nThe assessment performed is not an endorsement of either vaccine, but is intended to guide stakeholders and national authorities in whose countries clinical trials may be proposed. The final decision whether and when to proceed with any clinical trials is the sole prerogative of national authorities.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia Contacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Daniela Bagozzi\\n\\r\\n                        Senior Information Officer\\r\\n                    \\n\\nMobile:\\n+41796037281\\n\\n\\nEmail:\\nbagozzid@who.int \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\nMore about Ebola »   This page links all WHO technical and general information on Ebola Virus Disease.\\xa0FAQ: Compassionate use of investigational vaccine for the Ebola outbreak in DRCRead the Q and ANew Ebola therapeutic treatments\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegions\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\n\\n\\nAmericas\\n\\n\\nEastern Mediterranean\\n\\n\\nEurope\\n\\n\\nSouth-East Asia\\n\\n\\nWestern Pacific\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\nEthics\\n\\n\\nInformation disclosure\\n\\n\\nPermissions and licensing\\n\\n\\nPreventing sexual exploitation\\n\\n\\nTerms of use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\n\\nProcurement\\n\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         \\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\r\\n                                ©\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n                            2025\\r\\n\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nWHO\\n\\n                           '),\n",

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first doses of one of the three candidate vaccines against Sudan ebolavirus arrived in Uganda yesterday. These will be evaluated in a clinical trial called the Solidarity Against Ebola or Tokomeza Ebola.The arrival of the 1200 doses of candidate vaccines just 79 days after the outbreak was declared on 20 September marks a historical milestone in the global capacity to respond to outbreaks. To start Phase 3 trials in Guinea during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2015,\\xa0it was\\xa07 months from declaration to arrival of vaccines. This was a great achievement and set historical records at the time. That trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the Zaire ebolavirus—the one responsible for the West Africa outbreak and more recently, outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But there are no licensed vaccines against the Sudan ebolavirus species responsible for the current outbreak in Uganda, thus the need for the current trial. “Uganda is showing that life-saving research can be promptly organized in the midst of an outbreak,” said Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Acero, Uganda’s Minister of Health. “We will continue to fight the outbreak using the effective tools we already have, which are rapid surveillance to find cases, contact tracing teams identifying those who have been exposed, health workers providing care to those who are sick with the virus, and engaging the community throughout the response, but having a vaccine for this and future outbreaks is important.”The vaccine is one of the three candidates that were recommended for the trial by an independent WHO expert panel: Sabin\\xa0Vaccine Institute\\'s ChAd3-SUDV. The other two, cAdOx1 biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute/Serum Institute of India and Merck/IAVI\\'s SV-SUDV, will be added to the trial when doses arrive.The trial is led by Uganda’s Makerere University and co-sponsored by the Ministry of Health and WHO. WHO worked with the Ugandan government and researchers to design the protocol for the trial, ensure regulatory and ethical processes were speedy, to train research teams and to install the cold chain that will preserve the vaccines at optimal temperature. “The arrival of candidate vaccines in country less than 100 days since the outbreak was declared is the result of a global effort coordinated by WHO. Every time we work together to assess vaccines quickly, we improve. This has benefits now and into the future,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These aren’t trial runs: these are optimizing the system for the next disease threat.”Achieving this milestone is the result of previous preparation, such as WHO’s research and development blueprint which aligns researchers and others on priority areas of research. The milestone is also the result of investments from the US (including through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), the UK and other governments, and a no-regrets approach, which saw WHO bring together the Government of Uganda, vaccine researchers, manufacturers, funders, regulatory officials, and others. Manufacturers got vaccines into vials in record time, with sufficient doses of the candidate vaccines for the trial and potentially beyond.In an equally speedy and collaborative approach, several partners including CEPI, the Government of Canada, the EU’s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response department, and WHO have allocated funds to facilitate the trial implementation. Other partners are also considering their contributions.“This trial is a significant and promising step towards possible protection against the Sudan ebolavirus with African researchers taking a leading role. It showcases the power of scientific research on our continent and how working in collaboration with international partners we can develop critical tools that will limit the lethal effect of Ebola,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “We have recruited and trained 9 research teams ready to be deployed in the districts where the trial will take place.” Professor Bruce Kirenga, the Principal Investigator for the vaccine trial.\"We hope that through the trial we will provide sufficient information to know how effective one or more of the candidate vaccines are, although it will take time to gather quality data,\" Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the WHO Representative in Uganda. \"We are working hand in hand with all partners involved to ensure that the trial will be delivered to high scientific and ethical standards.\" Since the outbreak was declared, the country has recorded a total of 142 confirmed cases and 55 deaths in nine districts, as of 5 December. Early diagnosis and treatment of cases have been critical in curbing infections, in addition to improved disease surveillance and contact tracing, infection, prevention and control as well as mobilizing communities to support the response.There have been no new Ebola cases reported since 27 November. Contacts of recently confirmed cases will be invited to participate in the trial, which is designed to be implemented using a ring vaccination design.   \\xa0--\\xa0Notes to editor:This is a timeline of key moments in this response.7 June, 2022WHO’s research strategic agenda for filovirus research and monitoring 2021-2031 is published. 20 September, 2022Ministry of Health of Uganda declares the outbreak following laboratory confirmation.

In total\\xa0during this outbreak,\\xa0there were\\xa0164 cases\\xa0(142 confirmed and\\xa022 probable), 55 confirmed deaths and 87 recovered patients.WHO and partners supported Ugandan health authorities from the outset of the outbreak, deploying experts, providing training in contact tracing, testing and patient care, as well as building isolation and treatment centres and providing laboratory testing kits.On 11 January 2023, Uganda declared the end of the outbreak.\\xa0Because this outbreak was caused by the Sudan ebolavirus, one of six species of the Ebola virus against which there are no approved therapeutics and vaccines, WHO worked with partners—including vaccines developers, researchers, donors and the Ugandan health authorities—to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines that could be included in trials.\\xa0Three candidate vaccines were identified and over 5000 doses of these\\xa0were sent to the country. The speed of this collaboration marked a milestone in the global capacity to respond to rapidly evolving outbreaks and prevent them from becoming larger.\\xa0\\xa0WHO will continue to work with Uganda’s health authorities and partners to maintain surveillance, support survivors, and\\xa0advance vaccine and therapeutics research.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisease outbreak newsEbola virus diseaseFact sheetSituation reports Country OfficeRegional Office\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegional news\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUganda declares end of Ebola disease outbreak\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                11 January 2023\\r\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 November 2022\\n\\nStatement\\n\\n\\nGlobal health agencies outline plan to support Ugandan government-led response to outbreak of ebola virus disease\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMinistry of Health and Development partners tour Ebola Treatment Units to strengthen response preparedness in the country\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                21 October 2022\\r\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfrican health ministers take steps to curb Ebola disease outbreak\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                12 October 2022\\r\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact tracers and village health teams take on Ebola in UgandaIn Uganda, fighting Ebola one patient at a time - 10 October 2022Ministry of Health, WHO and USAID strengthen protection of Health Workers During the Ebola Outbreak Response in Uganda - 7 October 2022Uganda Defines Priorities and Needs in Its Ebola Response Plan - 1 October 2022Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola outbreak declared over, Uganda boosts response - 27 September 2022Health Development Partners Mobilized to End the Ebola Outbreak in Uganda - 26 September 2022WHO bolsters Ebola disease outbreak response in Uganda - 22 September 2022Uganda declares Ebola Virus Disease outbreak - 20 September 2022 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications\\nAll →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16 February 2020\\n\\n\\nGuidelines for the management of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the context of Ebola virus disease\\n\\n\\n\\nA paucity of scientific evidence exists on how to best treat pregnant or breastfeeding women with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD).

While we expanded our efforts to put a strong response in place across the nine affected districts, the magic bullet has been our communities who understood the importance of doing what\\xa0was needed to end the outbreak, and took action,” said Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero, Uganda’s Minister of Health.\\nIt was the country’s first Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in a decade and its fifth overall for this kind of Ebola. In total there were\\xa0164 cases\\xa0(142 confirmed and\\xa022 probable), 55 confirmed deaths and 87 recovered patients. More than 4000 people who came in contact with confirmed cases were followed up and their health monitored for 21 days. Overall, the case-fatality ratio was 47%. The last patient was released from care on 30 November when the 42-day countdown to the end of the outbreak began.\\xa0\\nHealth authorities showed strong political commitment and implemented accelerated public health actions. People in the hot-spot communities of Mubende and Kasanda experienced restricted movements.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I congratulate Uganda for its robust and comprehensive response which has resulted in today’s victory over Ebola,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General. “Uganda has shown that Ebola can be defeated when the whole system works together, from having an alert system in place, to finding and caring for people affected and their contacts, to gaining the full participation of affected communities in the response. Lessons learned and the systems put in place for this outbreak will protect Ugandans and others in the years ahead.”\\nThis Ebola outbreak was caused by the Sudan ebolavirus, one of six species of the Ebola virus against which no therapeutics and vaccines have been approved yet. However, Uganda’s long experience in responding to epidemics allowed the country to rapidly strengthen critical areas of the response and overcome the lack of these key tools.\\xa0\\n“With no vaccines and therapeutics, this was one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks in the past five years, but Uganda stayed the course and continuously fine-tuned its response. Two months ago, it looked as if Ebola would cast a dark shadow over the country well into 2023, as the outbreak reached major cities such as Kampala and Jinja, but this win starts off the year on a note of great hope for Africa,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSoon after Uganda declared the Sudan ebolavirus outbreak, WHO worked with a large range of partners, including vaccines developers, researchers, donors and the Ugandan health authorities to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials. Three candidate vaccines were identified and over 5000 doses of these arrived in the country with the first batch on 8 December and the last two on 17 December. The speed of this collaboration marks a milestone in the global capacity to respond to rapidly evolving outbreaks and prevent them from becoming larger.\\xa0\\n“While these candidate vaccines were not used during this outbreak, they remain the contribution of Uganda and partners to the fight against Ebola. The next time the Sudan ebolavirus strikes we can reignite the robust cooperation between developers, donors and health authorities and dispatch the candidate vaccines,” said Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO Representative in Uganda.\\nWHO and partners supported Ugandan health authorities from the outset of the outbreak, deploying experts, providing training in contact tracing, testing and patient care, as well as building isolation and treatment centres and providing laboratory testing kits. Due to the joint efforts, the processing time for Ebola samples dropped from a few days to six hours. WHO helped to protect frontline health workers by organizing a steady supply of personal protective equipment. The Organization provided nearly US$ 6.5 million to Uganda’s response and an additional US$ 3 million to support readiness in six neighbouring countries.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlthough the outbreak\\xa0in\\xa0Uganda\\xa0has been\\xa0declared over, health authorities are maintaining surveillance and are ready to respond quickly to any flare-ups. A follow-up programme has been put in place to support survivors. Neighbouring countries remain on alert and are encouraged to continue strengthening their capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\n\\n\\n\\nNatalie Ridgard\\n\\n\\nCommunication Officer\\nWHO Regional Office for Africa\\nEmail: ridgardn [at] who.int (ridgardn[at]who[dot]int)\\nTel: +254 11 289 0666\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElise Tcheutchoua Yonkeu\\n\\n\\nCommunications Officer\\nWHO Uganda\\nEmail:\\xa0tcheutchouae [at] who.int (tcheutchouae[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSakuya OKA\\n\\n\\nCommunications Manager\\nWHO\\xa0Regional Office for Africa\\nEmail: okas [at] who.int (okas[at]who[dot]int)\\nTel: +242 06 508 1009\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp and services\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\nGeneral inquiries\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\nWHO country offices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO Offices\\n\\n\\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\\n\\n\\nWHO European Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Headquarters\\n\\n\\nWHO Region of the Americas\\n\\n\\nWHO South-East Asia Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Western Pacific Region\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\n\\nRss Feed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing the declaration of an Ebola outbreak in Uganda on 20 September 2022, the outbreak has now spread to seven districts (Kasanda, Kyegegwa, Bunyangabu and Kagadi districts beyond the original epicenter in Mubende district, and then to Kampala City and Wakiso). The government-led response has activated\\xa0the Incident Management System in order to control the outbreak. In support of the Ministry of Health-led efforts, CEPI, Gavi and WHO have outlined a plan to accelerate research during the outbreak, to ensure access to investigational doses, and to facilitate scaling up and access to any subsequent licensed vaccine.Vaccination is usually one of the response interventions in such an outbreak, however, there are currently no licensed vaccines (or therapeutics) for Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), though there are several candidate vaccines which appear to be suitable for evaluation in a clinical trial during this outbreak.By embedding research at heart of the outbreak response, we can achieve two goals: to evaluate potentially efficacious candidate vaccines, and to potentially contribute to end this outbreak, and protect populations at risk in the future.The Ministry of Health has designated the Makerere University Lung Institute to conduct vaccine and therapeutics clinical trials. The clinical trial to evaluate candidate vaccines against this ebolavirus is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Health in Uganda and WHO, and involves support from partners. A Principal investigator from Makerere University Lung Institute will lead the vaccine trial.\\xa0WHO, CEPI and Gavi are providing support to ensure that sufficient doses of candidate vaccines are available for the trial and beyond.\\xa0 If sufficient doses can be made available, the aim of the vaccine trial would be to establish how effective the candidate vaccines are in diverse populations. The vaccine developers and funders who will make the candidate vaccines available include the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the US government institutions Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and MSD.Moreover, there are other organisations committed to supporting the overall response, including Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), UNICEF, non-governmental organizations, donors, and regulators including the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF).Goals of the collaborationThe following goals have been identified for the organizations’ efforts; these are likely to evolve in response to the outbreak.In the short term, supporting the Ministry of Health of Uganda’s outbreak response efforts as needed to control SUDV and, under their leadership, support a randomized clinical trial to evaluate one or more candidate vaccines as part of the response to the outbreak.In the mid-term, allocating resources to plan for and to reserve sufficient manufacturing capacity to scale up the production of candidate vaccines (even before they are licensed), potentially by establishing a risk-sharing mechanism. This may also involve manufacture of additional vaccines at risk during the trial to ensure that doses of a vaccine found to be efficacious vaccine can be made available to end the outbreak as quickly as possible.Over the longer term, exploring pathways to ensure that licensed SUDV vaccine(s) are available via the Ebola stockpile, which is enabled and funded by Gavi and managed by UNICEF on behalf of the WHO-coordinated International Coordinating Group (ICG) mechanism on Vaccine Provision, potentially using innovative market shaping mechanisms.\\xa0Furthermore, committing to developing a mechanism to ensure equitable access and funding for SUDV vaccines research, outbreak response and preventive vaccination. Also, to provide support for development and evaluation of next generation vaccines.The signatories commit to be guided by the following principles:\\xa0Leverage organisational strengths towards a common goal: Considering each institutions’ mandate and mission and its expertise, all pledged to increase coordination and support the overarching agreed goals which cut across the remit of any one institutionCountry driven and country engaged: Commit to support the Ministries of Health experiencing the outbreaks and ensure any engagement with the countries is coordinated and aligned with the Ministry of Health and responds to locally identified needsDecision making which is evidence-informed and considers access: Commit to ensure decision making builds on robust scientific assessment of candidate vaccines and considers implications for future equitable access to a licensed vaccineEnd-to-end approach based on access and equity: Achieve development and delivery goals by accelerating research and development, as well as push and pull mechanisms and other innovative financing – with access and equity centred at each stageEfficient resource allocation: Ensure adequate funding and resources are available in a timely manner and aligned with national research and response prioritiesResearch integrity and ethics: Conduct research integrated in the response to outbreaks and in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.Global research and development collaboration in response to Ebola outbreaks \\xa0The actions taken by the Ministry of Health in Uganda and its partners build on past collaboration and experiences responding to Zaire ebolavirus outbreaks (another Ebola virus species), on COVAX lessons learned, and on working on other vaccine stockpile mechanisms.A commitment to encourage availability of doses for the candidate vaccines for clinical trial and beyond. In 2014, the Gavi Board approved a funding envelope for accelerated access to Ebola vaccines including eventual procurement of licensed vaccines, vaccine delivery and support for recovery in affected countries. Gavi subsequently signed an Advance Purchase Commitment (APC) agreement with Merck, securing the commitment to achieve and maintain availability of 300,000 doses of investigational vaccine doses until licensure and WHO recommendation.Integrating clinical research in the outbreak response. Together with the Ministry of Health in Guinea, WHO was part of a broader coalition of countries and partners which worked to assess candidate Ebola vaccines in the context of the West Africa Ebola outbreak caused by Zaire ebolavirus species.\\xa0 In 2014, a WHO-led global consortium rapidly initiated the necessary Phase 1 trials (VEBCON) and a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in Guinea led by the Ministry of Health and WHO with several other partners which generated the evidence on the efficacy of the rVSV- ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. Additional clinical trials to evaluate various vaccines were conducted in 2015 by the Ministries of Health of Liberia and Sierra Leone and with the support of the US National Institutes of Health, The US Centers for Disease Control and the London School of Hygiene and Public Health among others. The experience of the West Africa Ebola outbreak catalysed the establishment of the WHO R&D Blueprint for epidemics by the World Health Assembly in 2015 after CEPI in 2016.Deploying vaccines with proven efficacy yet unlicensed as part of the outbreak response. After 2015 and before its licensure, the proven effective yet unlicensed vaccine was successfully deployed as part of the response to Ebola outbreaks until 2021 under the leadership of the Ministries of health and with support from WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and other partners. In all the outbreaks since 2016 Ministries of Health, WHO, and several partners have also collected additional evidence on the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. Despite the challenges, during the 2018-2020 outbreaks in Equateur, North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, over 320,000 people at risk of Ebola (contacts, contacts of contacts, and health care and front-line workers in affected areas) received a safe and effective vaccine.Creating a mechanism to ensure availability and access to licensed vaccines. In 2019, the Gavi Board approved funding for the establishment of a global stockpile of licensed Ebola vaccines, administered via the ICG mechanism – initially with investigational doses and then licensed vaccine for Ebola Zaire – but with potential to include other vaccines, depending vaccine availability and following WHO recommendations. Stockpile of licensed doses have since been used to combat recent smaller outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea.A global, end-to-end collaboration to promote equitable access in support of countries’ strategies and needs. Beyond Ebola, the lessons from the COVID-19 response, including the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and key learnings from the vaccine pillar COVAX, are particularly important for the field of vaccine R&D, manufacturing, delivery and country and community engagement.\\xa0Notes to editorsAbout CEPICEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, launched in 2017, to develop vaccines against future epidemics. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic threats so they can be accessible to all people in need. Prior to COVID-19, CEPI’s work focused on developing vaccines against Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Chikungunya virus – it has over 20 vaccine candidates against these pathogens in development. CEPI has also invested in new platform technologies for rapid vaccine development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).CEPI has played a central role in the global response to COVID-19, supporting the development of the world’s largest portfolio of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with a focus on speed, scale and access, as well as co-leading COVAX, the global initiative to deliver fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. CEPI is also the world’s leading funder of R&D for broadly protective coronavirus vaccines which could protect against future variants of COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential.CEPI has embarked upon an ambitious US$3.5bn five-year plan – called CEPI 2.0 - to dramatically reduce or even eliminate the future risk of pandemics and epidemics. Central to the plan is CEPI’s goal – supported by the G7 and G20 - to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days. Achieving this ‘100 Days Mission’ would give the world a fighting chance of containing a future outbreak before it spreads to become a global pandemic. Read the plan at endpandemics.cepi.net/About GaviGavi, the Vaccine Alliance is a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world’s children against some of the world’s deadliest diseases. Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has helped to immunise a whole generation – over 981 million children – and prevented more than 16.2 million future deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 73 lower-income countries. Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems as well as funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. After two decades of progress, Gavi is now focused on protecting the next generation, above all the zero-dose children who have not received even a single vaccine shot. The Vaccine Alliance employs innovative finance and the latest technology – from drones to biometrics – to save millions more lives, prevent outbreaks before they can spread and help countries on the road to self-sufficiency. Gavi is a co-convener of COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, together with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. In its role, Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery.The Vaccine Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, technical agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other private sector partners.

The center, which also has nine (9) High Dependency Care beds recently discharged five health workers who had managed successfully and recovered.\\n“I want to appreciate our front liners - the health workers who have dedicated their lives to serve and save the people of Uganda. Your commitment and determination do not go unnoticed and without you, there is no life,” said Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng.\\nWith support from WHO and the generous contribution of partners including the Norwegian government, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), the center has trained 30 health workers in the Ebola response. Through WHO support, a WHO case management expert and a senior MoH specialist doctor from Mulago hospital have been deployed to support case management and training at the site.\\nThe WHO health organization has also provided discharge kits for the five health workers who were cured, assorted infection prevention and control (IPC) and case management supplies, three (3) monitors, three (3) ventilators, and three (3) defibrillators from funding for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) preparedness in 2018/2019.\\n“We are committed to continuing working with the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Health to ensure that the Ebola outbreak is contained. WHO is supporting all response pillars including case management to make sure that all cases are managed properly,” said Dr. Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the WHO Representative to Uganda.\\nAt the Mulago Hospital, the team toured the recently opened isolation unit capable of managing 120 patient at a time. The center is currently used for the isolation of high-risk suspects and other contacts pending confirmation of their test results. The team also visited the site at Mulago that was been earmarked for expansion for additional ETU beds. The construction of the new Site will be done by MSF who have also supported ETU construction in Mubende.\\nWHO has supported the treatment center at Mulago with one standard Viral hemorrhagic Fever kit (VHF PPE) that has supplies and equipment adequate for staff protection, assorted case management, and infection prevention and control supplies for use in the treatment. A 200 kva diesel generator was also supplied to provide power backup at the treatment center.\\n“I appreciate the support received so far from development partners towards the Ebola response. Strong partnerships and collaboration are the cornerstones of any response. I urge you to mobilize more resources to enable us to contain this outbreak,” said Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng.\\nSince the Ebola outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Health on 20 September 2022, the country has so far recorded 64 cumulative confirmed cases and 25 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 39% as of 19 October 2022.\\nResponse efforts are ongoing in the country to strengthen case management, contact tracing and community engagement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\n\\n\\n\\nElise Tcheutchoua Yonkeu\\n\\n\\nCommunications Officer\\nWHO Uganda\\nEmail:\\xa0tcheutchouae [at] who.int (tcheutchouae[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp and services\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\nGeneral inquiries\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\nWHO country offices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO Offices\\n\\n\\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\\n\\n\\nWHO European Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Headquarters\\n\\n\\nWHO Region of the Americas\\n\\n\\nWHO South-East Asia Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Western Pacific Region\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\n\\nRss Feed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

The population is mobile due to trade, social and cultural connections. In addition, the country hosts many refugees who continue to keep ties with their countries of origin.\\nRecognizing the importance of collaborative efforts, the Government of Uganda, with support from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and WHO today hosted a High-Level Emergency Ministerial meeting on Cross Border Collaboration for Preparedness and Response to Ebola Disease Outbreaks in Kampala.\\nThe meeting concluded with a communique in which Ministers of Health and senior government officials from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda endorsed key measures to prevent the cross-border spread of the Sudan Ebolavirus. These include disease surveillance, contact tracing and monitoring, prompt alert notification, information sharing and joint trainings of emergency responders, as well as carrying out simulation exercises to enhance preparedness and response.\\n“Uganda has experience in managing epidemics and since the beginning of this Ebola outbreak, with the support of our partners, we have taken measures to limit the transmission of the disease. Sharing experience and strengthening collaboration between our countries will enable us to respond quickly and efficiently to health emergencies affecting our countries,” said Hon Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Acero, Uganda’s Minister of Health.\\nUganda declared an outbreak of the Sudan ebolavirus on 20 September 2022, marking the first time this species – one of the six under the Ebolavirus genus – was detected in the country since 2012.\\xa0\\n“One of the crucial lessons Africa has learnt from previous Ebola outbreaks is that by uniting, we stay a step ahead of the virus. Through sharing information and resources, countries can go from firefighting to building an outbreak firewall and halting the spread of infections,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The joint efforts agreed upon today place Uganda and the region on the road to breaking Ebola’s grip.”\\nThe outbreak has affected five districts, and as of 12 October 2022, 54 confirmed cases and 19 deaths have been reported. With the intensifying response, more than a thousand contacts have been identified, while 20 people have recovered from the disease.\\n“We as a continent must work together to plan, prepare and respond to the Ebola outbreak and other public health threats through resource sharing, regional efforts to build resilience capacity of human resources, strengthening laboratory systems, surveillance, treatment and care,” said Dr Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, Acting Director General of the Africa CDC, emphasizing the need for collaboration efforts in ensuring health security of the Eastern Africa region and beyond. He also called for action to support the implementation of the Africa New Public Health Order.\\nThe Ministers of Health also agreed on joint plans to carry out cross-border readiness, including raising public awareness and conducting community engagement campaigns. They also agreed to the rapid cross-border deployment of medical personnel to tackle the disease.\\nAs no effective vaccine against the Sudan ebolavirus has been licenced yet, Ugandan health authorities have focused on supportive care for confirmed cases alongside stepping up testing, surveillance, infection prevention and control, as well as collaborating with communities to support disease prevention measures.\\nThere are at least six candidate vaccines against Sudan ebolavirus, which are in different stages of development. Three of them have Phase1 data (safety and immunogenicity data in humans), and the remaining are in the preclinical evaluation phase.\\n\\nAbout the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\\nAfrica CDC is a specialized technical institution of the African Union that strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions and partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks based on data-driven interventions and programs.

Every contact tracer works with a maximum of 10 village health workers, who are volunteers trained in diseases surveillance. Recruited by communities, village health teams help build trust and overcome fears among responders.\\nIn addition to the deployment of contact tracers, two hotlines were created for people to report suspected cases. Investigators follow a list of questions meant to assess the need to dispatch an ambulance or a clinical officer. Once a case is confirmed, a case investigation team establishes a list of contacts, depending on where the patient was likely to have been infected and who they may have met afterwards.\\nAfter contacts have been located and screened, village health teams take over to monitor them for any symptoms for 21 days—the Ebola incubation period. Beyond this important supporting role, these teams also provide invaluable assistance in raising awareness of the disease within their communities. Since the start of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health has trained over 1200 village health team members, also with support from WHO and partners.\\xa0\\nWith only 25% of contacts followed every day in the first days of the outbreak, contact tracing quickly improved. By mid-October, nearly 94% of 552 contacts were seen and monitored daily for 21 days.\\nLydia Nasamba, a market trader and a resident of Madudu, has been a member of a local village health team for more than eight years. “Every day at 3 pm, I go to the sub-county community radio station, where I raise awareness about Ebola, its symptoms, preventive measures and how to report cases,” she says. “After that, I visit the identified contacts in my community to check their health status.”\\nWhile the contribution of people like Kirrungi and Nasamba was a crucial component of Uganda’s Ebola response, they faced numerous daily challenges, including a lack of personal protective equipment and reliable transport. Contact tracers are often faced with community members’ fear of being stigmatized or isolated in a health facility, which puts people’s livelihood at risk. Contacts may also not be home when contact tracers visit them, which makes it difficult to monitor them on daily basis.\\xa0\\nWith further support from the United States Agency for International Development and the Norwegian government, WHO provided four Ebola kits to Mubende Regional Hospital, deployed and repurposed 108 technical staff to assist with case management, risk communication, community engagement and laboratory testing.\\nBack on the ground in Madudu, nothing deterred Kirrungi from the task at hand. “Since I have been involved in the Ebola response, I feel like I am saving lives. I have learned that if all contacts are identified and treated, the disease will disappear,” she says. “That\\'s what motivates me every day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\n\\n\\n\\nElise Tcheutchoua Yonkeu\\n\\n\\nCommunications Officer\\nWHO Uganda\\nEmail:\\xa0tcheutchouae [at] who.int (tcheutchouae[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNatalie Ridgard\\n\\n\\nCommunication Officer\\nWHO Regional Office for Africa\\nEmail: ridgardn [at] who.int (ridgardn[at]who[dot]int)\\nTel: +254 11 289 0666\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeenakshi Dalal\\n\\n\\nMedia Relations Officer\\nWHO Regional Office for Africa\\nEmail:\\xa0dalalm [at] who.int (dalalm[at]who[dot]int)\\nTel: +254 703 245 761 (WhatsApp)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp and services\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\nGeneral inquiries\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\nWHO country offices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO Offices\\n\\n\\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\\n\\n\\nWHO European Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Headquarters\\n\\n\\nWHO Region of the Americas\\n\\n\\nWHO South-East Asia Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Western Pacific Region\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\n\\nRss Feed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

2024\\n\\nKinshasa – “Getting the Ebola vaccine has given me a deep sense of security and will allow me to concentrate fully on my work,” says Chrysostome Kavusa Mwenderwa, a health care worker at Kalunguta Referral Hospital in Beni, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\nKavusa, 42, is among 18 748 frontline and health care workers in 12 health zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu province who were vaccinated against Ebola between June and September 2023, part of a drive by World Health Organization (WHO) in support of countries to help boost epidemic preparedness, and save lives.\\n“Health care workers are responsible for preventing disease, responding to outbreaks, and mitigating risk in communities. But the nature of their work puts them at increased risk for deadly infectious diseases such as Ebola, so preventive vaccination is crucial wherever possible,” says Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\nAlong with supporting preparedness efforts, Ebola vaccination also helps strengthen health systems, paving the way for adult vaccination programmes, Sambo adds.\\n“We have leveraged professional associations of physicians, nurses, midwifes and laboratory technicians, as well as of Ebola survivors, along with education and religious bodies and humanitarian partners, to encourage prophylactic vaccination for frontline and health care workers,” says Dr Nanou Yanga Mukadi, Cholera Vaccination Focal Point and EPI Ebola Vaccination Officer.\\n“Planning begins at grassroots level, with support from the intermediate and central levels and from partners, including WHO. One important aspect to highlight is awareness-raising. In addition, in-process and end-of-process monitoring is carried out to ensure that the targets are met,” Mukadi adds.\\nAlong with Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau and Uganda have also begun preventive vaccination efforts. WHO urges other countries at high risk to also consider preventive Ebola vaccination.\\nEbola is a severe and often fatal illness, with death rates of 70% to 90% when untreated. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa devastated communities and health services alike. WHO is encouraging countries to prioritize the use of the vaccine as a powerful public health tool to protect health care workers and other frontline service providers at high risk of exposure.\\nIn 2023, WHO made a total of 111 497 doses of the ERVEBO® vaccine from the global stockpile available to high-risk African countries, with the aim of ramping up country preparedness for future outbreaks. WHO also supported the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to plan and coordinate preventive Ebola vaccination activities at operational and strategic levels.\\nHealth care worker Kavusa Mwenderwa explains the threat from the Ebola virus: “Ebola is transmitted through contact with an infected patient’s blood or bodily fluids, or even through contact with clothing or bed linen contaminated with bodily fluids. Given the nature of our work, the risk to us as health workers is high.”\\nDuring early phases of an Ebola virus outbreak, health care workers are often first affected, which can lead to unnecessary deaths, staff shortages, and transmission to other patients.\\nHis colleague, Remacle Kasereka Kitutu, 40, agrees: “The importance of getting vaccinated cannot be overemphasized.

After learning that he could still sexually transmit the virus up to 90 days after recovery, he resolved to do everything possible to ensure the safety of his wife.\\nVarney was among more than 11 000 patients infected with the virus during the more than two-year-long outbreak in Liberia. He was also one of 857 survivors enrolled in the subsequent Men’s Health Screening Programme, led by Liberia’s Health Ministry, in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\n“I wanted to be associated with the programme because I wanted to know what was happening to me. I didn’t want to put my wife and family at risk.” Randall Varney, Ebola survivor\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nThe programme, launched in July 2015 after the third and fourth waves of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia were attributed to sexual transmission, aimed to provide semen testing services and safe sex counselling to male Ebola survivors aged 15 years and older.\\nInitiated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, Liberia became the first country to declare all enrolled men safe in July 2022, following two successive negative tests each. In March 2023, the Ministry of Health officially ended the programme with a closing ceremony attended by Minister of Health Dr Wilhemina Jallah, National Public Health Institute staff, partners, as well as Varney and many of the other enrolled men.\\n“Findings from the programme, and the lessons learned, will not only benefit Liberia, but the world,” says Dr Jallah.\\n\\n“Findings from the programme, and the lessons learned, will not only benefit Liberia, but the world.” Dr Wilhelmina Jallah, Minister of Health, Liberia\\xa0\\n\\nDr Julius Monday, the health emergencies team lead at WHO’s Liberia country office, explains that given limited pre-existing data, the potential for the virus to persist in survivors was identified as an important research topic early in the epidemic.\\n“This need became even more clear when a Liberian woman tested positive for Ebola infection, and epidemiological investigation found that her only exposure was unprotected vaginal intercourse with a male survivor, whose semen tested positive for Ebola RNA 200 days after he first became symptomatic,” he adds.\\n\\nDespite the deep associated stigma, Varney was eager to enrol. “I wanted to be associated with the programme because I wanted to know what was happening to me. I didn’t want to put my wife and family at risk,” he recalls.\\nOver the six years of the programme, survivors were tested every two weeks. WHO also developed the Ebola Virus Persistence Risk Reduction Behavioural Counselling Protocol to identify barriers to risk reduction, and facilitated a personalized Ebola risk-reduction plan, particularly around condom use and abstinence.\\nIn addition, WHO provided the protocols, guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures for the programme, along with supplies for sample collections, packaging and consumables.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\n\\n\\n\\nMs Letitia Nangwale\\n\\n\\nCommunications OfficerPhone : (266) 590 17166Email: nangwalel [at] who.int (nangwalel[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeenakshi Dalal\\n\\n\\nMedia Relations Officer\\nWHO Regional Office for Africa\\nEmail:\\xa0dalalm [at] who.int (dalalm[at]who[dot]int)\\nTel: +254 703 245 761 (WhatsApp)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Links\\n\\nMaking Africa healthier\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp and services\\n\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\nGeneral inquiries\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\nWHO country offices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO Offices\\n\\n\\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\\n\\n\\nWHO European Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Headquarters\\n\\n\\nWHO Region of the Americas\\n\\n\\nWHO South-East Asia Region\\n\\n\\nWHO Western Pacific Region\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\n\\nRss Feed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Équateur Province, DRC\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview\\n\\n\\nOn 23 April 2022 health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola after a case was confirmed in Mbandaka, a city in the north-western Equateur Province. This was the third outbreak in the province since 2018.The Democratic Republic of the Congo had  experienced its fourteenth Ebola outbreaks since 1976, the last outbreak being the sixth since 2018 alone – the most frequent occurrence in the country’s Ebola history. Previous outbreaks in Equateur Province were in 2020 and 2018, with 130 and 54 recorded cases respectively.On 4 July 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of the Ebola outbreak. Due to the robust response by the national authorities this outbreak was brought to an end swiftly with limited transmission of the virus. Crucial lessons have been learned from past outbreaks and they have been applied to devise and deploy an ever more effective Ebola response.WHO and partners are working with communities to encourage people to report any suspected cases and therefore allow for timely testing. WHO continues to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo to strengthen outbreak response to infectious diseases and other public health issues. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEbola disease outbreak newsEbola situation reports (Regional Office for Africa)Weekly bulletins on outbreaks and other emergencies in the African Region\\xa0Ebola virus disease \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegional Office News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAFRO Press Release\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo declares new Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka\\n\\n23 April 2020\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews\\nAll →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30 July 2025\\n\\nDepartmental update\\n\\n\\nPaying tribute to David Nabarro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n26 March 2025\\n\\nDepartmental update\\n\\n\\nWHO Launches Online Training to Strengthen Filovirus Outbreak Response\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks\\n\\n\\nR&D Blueprint and Ebola/MarburgRisk CommunicationsInternationals health regulationsEarly warning signs and alert systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial media updates\\n\\n\\nWHO Africa RegionWHO Democratic Republic of CongoTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegions\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\n\\n\\nAmericas\\n\\n\\nEastern Mediterranean\\n\\n\\nEurope\\n\\n\\nSouth-East Asia\\n\\n\\nWestern Pacific\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\nEthics\\n\\n\\nInformation disclosure\\n\\n\\nPermissions and licensing\\n\\n\\nPreventing sexual exploitation\\n\\n\\nTerms of use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\n\\nProcurement\\n\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         \\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\r\\n                                ©\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n                            2025\\r\\n\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nWHO\\n\\n                           '),\n",

disease\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\nSituation at a glance\\n\\r\\n            On 27 September 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that affected Butanuka health area, Beni health zone, North Kivu province. In accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus infections) after the burial of the last and only confirmed case.\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nDescription of the situation\\n\\nOn 21 August 2022, the MoH of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an Ebola outbreak following laboratory confirmation via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Ebola virus in a fatal case in Beni health zone, North Kivu province.The case was a 46-year-old woman hospitalized and treated from 23 July to 15 August (23 days) for symptoms that included cough, headache, polyarthralgia (joint pain), and physical asthenia (general fatigue), thought to be related to her known co-morbidities. The patient died in hospital on 15 August 2022. The body was returned to the family and buried in a traditional manner on 16 August prior to receipt of the laboratory results.Samples of blood and oropharyngeal secretions tested positive for Zaire ebolavirus by RT-PCR at the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Beni (INRB) on 15 August and these were confirmed at Rodolphe Mérieux INRB Laboratory in Goma on 16 August. The outbreak was declared by the MoH following EVD confirmation testing and genetic sequencing.No additional confirmed or probable cases have been identified since 16 August. Of the 182 contacts of the case, 172 were identified and monitored for 21 days. The 10 contacts who were not followed up were unable to be reached.Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic health response\\n\\nOverall response:\\xa0The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, conducted response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. National and district emergency management committees were activated to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on outbreak prevention and control interventions.Alerts and testing: During this outbreak, from 21 August to 27 September 2022, a total of 9173 alerts were reported from Beni health zone, and all (100%) were investigated, including 607 (7%) validated as suspected cases of EVD. A total of 682 samples were tested for EVD.Points of entry: A total of 2390 (92%) of 2608 travelers registered at points of entry were screened for EVD, and no alerts were detected.Vaccination: As of 27 September, 550 persons in the affected health zone have been vaccinated against EVD using the ring strategy, targeting contacts and contacts of contact. Frontline health care workers made up the majority of those vaccinated (483).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO risk assessment\\n\\nThis latest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 days after the burial of the last and only confirmed case on 16 August 2022. This case is genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu provinces. (For more information on this outbreak, please see the WHO outbreak account related to the 2018-2020 event). The source of this most recent outbreak has not yet been identified.A future outbreak is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country. Ebola virus is enzootic and a resurgence from viral persistence in survivors described in recent epidemics. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; gaps remain in the country's capacity to recover, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the Eastern part of the country have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources.A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors — including community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability — in some specific areas such as North Kivu province can increase the risk for new outbreaks of EVD. Moreover, improved capacities in detection, laboratory confirmation and increased surveillance may explain the increased frequency in detecting EVD outbreaks. Nevertheless, WHO is concerned that ongoing challenges regarding insecurity as well as health system challenges (epidemiological surveillance, IPC programmes and practices in health care settings), coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and other ongoing outbreaks, may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO advice\\n\\nWHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or non-human primates and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.Continue training and retraining      of health personnel for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD      cases as well as retraining on safe and dignified burials.Reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors. WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for the Ebola virus.Reduce amplification of transmission through health care by strengthening IPC programmes within the health care system.Provide ongoing training of the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices.Build and maintain capacities for logistic support in at-risk areas or countries.Based on the\\xa0current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther information\\n\\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo declares the end of 15th Ebola outbreak.

announced an outbreak of Ebola virus disease on 14 February 2021 after a cluster of cases was reported in the sub-prefecture of Gouécké, Nzérékoré Region. This was the first time the disease was reported in Guinea since the previous outbreak ended in 2016.\\xa0Shortly after the infections were detected, national health authorities, with support from WHO and partners, mounted a swift response, tapping into the expertise gained in fighting recent outbreaks both in Guinea and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.WHO helped ship around 24 000 Ebola vaccine doses and supported the vaccination of nearly 11 000 people at high risk, including over 2800 frontline workers.\\xa0On 19 June 2021, the outbreak was declared over. A total of 16 confirmed and 7 probable cases were reported, of whom 12 people died.WHO continues to support Guinea in its efforts to remain vigilant, maintain surveillance and build capacity to respond quickly to a possible resurgence of the virus. An Ebola laboratory, treatment infrastructure, logistics capacity and infection prevention measures have been reinforced to better respond to the disease as well as other health emergencies.Disease outbreak news - start of the outbreak - end of the outbreak\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmergency ListEbola virus diseaseEbola virus disease fact sheet Disease outbreak newsFunding \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegional Office News\\n\\n\\nEbola outbreak in Guinea declared over - 19 June 2021WHO steps up efforts to curb Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the CongoNew Ebola outbreak declared in Guinea\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO news\\nAll →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30 July 2025\\n\\nDepartmental update\\n\\n\\nPaying tribute to David Nabarro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n26 March 2025\\n\\nDepartmental update\\n\\n\\nWHO Launches Online Training to Strengthen Filovirus Outbreak Response\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 February 2025\\n\\nNews release\\n\\n\\nGroundbreaking Ebola vaccination trial launches today in Uganda\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks\\n\\n\\nRisk Communications Early Warning, Alert and Response System (EWARS)R&D Blueprint and Ebola/Marburg\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia\\n\\n\\nMedia package (photo/video)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n28 February 2025\\n\\nDonors making a difference: community engagement to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications\\nAll →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16 July 2025\\n\\n\\nRisk communication and community engagement readiness and response toolkit: ebola... \\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis toolkit is a comprehensive set of practical tools and resources designed to support country-level risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)...             \\n\\n\\nDownload\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19 March 2025\\n\\n\\nInfection prevention and control and water, sanitation and hygiene in health facilities during Ebola... \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) rapid assessment tool (RAT), is meant to assess health facilities with... \\n\\n\\n\\nDownload\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19 November 2024\\n\\n\\nFacilitation manual: psychological first aid during Ebola virus disease outbreaks, 2nd edition\\n\\n\\n\\nThis manual is designed\\r\\nto orient helpers to offer psychological first aid (PFA) to people affected by\\r\\nan Ebola outbreak.

These viruses can cause serious illness that, without treatment, can cause death. Orthoebolaviruses were discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.\\n\\nHealthcare providers:\\nReview guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola disease, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC\\n\\n\\n\\nTypes\\nThere are four orthoebolaviruses that cause illness in people:\\n\\nEbola virus (species Orthoebolavirus zairense) causes Ebola virus disease.\\nSudan virus (species Orthoebolavirus sudanense) causes Sudan virus disease.\\nTaï Forest virus (species Orthoebolavirus taiense) causes Taï Forest virus disease.\\nBundibugyo virus (species Orthoebolavirus bundibugyoense) causes Bundibugyo virus disease.\\n\\nSome orthoebolaviruses do not cause illness in people. Reston virus (species Orthoebolavirus restonense) can cause illness in nonhuman primates and pigs. Bombali virus (species Orthoebolavirus bombaliense) was identified in bats, but scientists don\\'t know if it causes illness in animals or people.\\n\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nPeople with Ebola disease may experience \"dry\" symptoms early in the course of illness. These symptoms may include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue. As the person becomes sicker, the illness typically progresses to \"wet\" symptoms and may include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding. \\nKeep Reading\\nSigns and Symptoms of Ebola Disease\\n\\n\\nHow long it takes for signs to show\\nSomeone with Ebola disease may start getting sick 2 to 21 days after contact with an orthoebolavirus. However, on average, symptoms begin 8 to 10 days after exposure.\\n\\n\\nRisk factors\\nHealthcare providers and family members caring for someone with Ebola disease without proper infection control methods have the highest risk of infection. \\nThe viruses that cause Ebola disease pose little risk to travelers or the general public.\\n\\n\\nHow it spreads\\nPeople can get Ebola disease through contact with the body fluids of an infected sick or dead person. Rarely, some people can get the disease from contact with an infected animal, like a bat or primate.\\nKeep Reading\\nHow Ebola Disease Spreads\\n\\n\\nPrevention\\nWhen living in or traveling to regions where viruses that spread Ebola disease may be present, take steps to protect yourself.\\nAvoid contact with body fluids\\nAvoid contact with body fluids from people and animals, including\\n\\nBlood and body fluids, like urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid from people who are sick.\\nSemen from someone who has recovered from Ebola disease, until testing shows that the virus is no longer in the semen.\\nClothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment, or other items that may have touched an infected person\\'s blood or body fluids.\\nThe body of someone who is suspected or confirmed to have had Ebola disease (such as during a funeral or burial practices).\\nBats, forest antelopes, primates, and blood, fluids, or raw meat from these or unknown animals.\\n\\nWear protective equipment\\nWear protective equipment if you come in contact with people who are sick or have died from Ebola disease, their blood and body fluids, or objects covered with their blood or body fluids.\\nMonitor your health\\nIf you return from an area with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, monitor your health for 21 days. Seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola disease.\\n\\nEbola Vaccine\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ERVEBO® for the prevention of Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only). Vaccination is recommended for U.S. adults 18 years and older who are at potential risk of exposure to the Ebola virus. Ebola Vaccine Product Information\\n\\n\\n\\nTesting and diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to diagnose Ebola disease. They can also test for orthoebolavirus antibodies.\\nSomeone being tested for Ebola disease should be separated from other people in a healthcare facility until results are confirmed.\\nHealth Care Providers\\nClinical Guidance for Ebola Disease\\n\\n\\nTreatment\\nTwo FDA-approved treatments2 are currently available to treat Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only): Inmazeb™ and Ebanga™.\\nSupportive care:\\nPatients have a much better chance of surviving if they receive: \\n\\nFluids and electrolytes (body salts) by mouth or into their veins.\\nMedicine to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain.\\nTreatment for other infections, if they occur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tOn This Page\\t\\n\\n\\nWhat it is\\nTypes\\nSigns and symptoms\\nHow long it takes for signs to show\\nRisk factors\\nHow it spreads\\nPrevention\\nTesting and diagnosis\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tApr. 23, 2024\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nSources\\nPrint\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\n\\nSyndicate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Source:\\nNational Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\\n\\nSources1 In an effort to decrease confusion of genus, species, and virus names, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) changed the genus name Ebolavirus to Orthoebolavirus.

These fruit bats may be the source of the virus. \\nInfected animals can spread the virus to other animals through contact with infected body fluids or items contaminated by these fluids. \\n\\nDid you know?\\u200e\\nWhen an infected animal spreads the virus to a person, it is called a spillover event.\\n\\nBetween people\\nAfter an initial spillover event, the virus can spread from person to person. A person becomes infected when their broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth come in contact with:\\n\\nBlood or body fluids from a person who is sick or has died from Ebola disease. Body fluids include urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and amniotic fluid.\\n\\n\\nObjects contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick or has died from Ebola disease. This can include clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment.\\n\\n\\nInfected animals, like bats, primates, or forest antelopes\\nThese viruses may spread through hunting, handling, or eating infected animals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSemen from a person who recovered from Ebola disease. This can happen through oral, vaginal, or anal sex.\\nThere is no evidence that orthoebolaviruses spread through contact with vaginal fluids from someone who has had Ebola disease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFact\\u200e\\nThere is no evidence that mosquitoes or other insects can spread the viruses that cause Ebola disease.\\n\\nView LargerDownload\\nEbola spreads between animals and then spills over to people.\\n\\n\\nWhen transmission is possible\\nPeople sick with Ebola disease can spread the virus to others when they start having symptoms. \\nSome Ebola survivors still carry the virus\\nAdvances in treatment mean more people are surviving Ebola disease. Sometimes people who survive Ebola disease can spread the virus even after their symptoms go away. This happens when the virus remains in certain parts of the body that are shielded from the immune system. \\nFor example, the virus can remain in semen even after someone recovers. Whether the virus is present in these body parts and or for how long varies by survivor.\\n\\n\\nWhat we're still learning\\nSome people who survive Ebola disease may develop antibodies that can last 10 years or longer. This may provide some protection from the species of orthoebolavirus that made them sick. Scientists don't know if survivors are immune for life, or if they can become infected with a different species of orthoebolavirus.\\nScientists continue to study the long-term effects of infection.

Neonates born to patients with confirmed Ebola disease should not breastfeed. Decisions to discharge the neonate should be made in conjunction with local public health authorities. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScope of guidance\\nAll available evidence on orthoebolavirus infection in neonates and persistence in breastmilk comes from patients infected with Ebola virus (species Orthoebolavirus zairense) during pregnancy. However, CDC expects this data to be applicable to all orthoebolaviruses that cause disease in people (Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Bundibugyo virus, Taï Forest virus).\\n\\n\\nBackground\\nSpontaneous fetal loss is high among patients who become infected during pregnancy123. Neonates born to patients with Ebola disease are often premature. They typically do not survive for more than a few weeks1456, with few published exceptions78. It's unclear whether these neonates die from in utero transmission of orthoebolavirus or from factors contributing to high infant mortality.6\\nThe first reported survival of an infant born to a patient infected with Ebola virus occurred in 2015. A 25-year-old previously healthy woman reported onset of symptoms eight days prior to delivery. The patient was treated with favipiravir on day 5 of her illness and died on day 8 (hospital day 5) due to severe vaginal bleeding after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The infant was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola disease survivor, and the antiviral GS-5734. Aside from seizure-like activity, the infant had no other symptoms and was discharged home. Subsequent follow-up demonstrated normal development and growth at 12 months of life.97\\nIn 2019, two neonates survived after being born to patients infected with Ebola virus. Both pregnant women died shortly after childbirth. Both the patient and neonate pairs received Ebola virus-specific monoclonal antibody treatment (Inmazeb, Ebanga)8. Inmazeb and Ebanga are now FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of Ebola virus disease due to Ebola virus in adult and pediatric patients.10\\nGiven the risk of vertical transmission and the high mortality of neonates infected with Ebola virus (species orthoebolavirus zairense), post-delivery administration of Inmazeb or Ebanga should be strongly considered for all live-born neonates of Ebola virus-positive patients.\\n\\n\\nClinical safety\\n Healthcare workers caring for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed or suspected Ebola disease should follow worker safety practices, in accordance with the principles of the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Neonatal Resuscitation Program1112. They should also follow guidance at the webpages below:\\nInfection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients in U.S. Hospitals who are Suspected or Confirmed to have Selected Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF)\\nGuidance for U.S. hospital staff caring for a suspected or confirmed VHF patient\\n\\n\\nPPE: Confirmed Patients and Clinically Unstable Patients Suspected to have VHF\\nGuidance on PPE for management of patients confirmed or suspected with selected VHF\\n\\n\\nInterim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals\\nVHF guidance for environmental infection control in U.S. hospitals\\n\\n\\nHandling VHF-Associated Waste\\nVHF Guidance for hospitals and healthcare personnel guidance on the safe handling of waste.\\n\\n Anyone handling the breast milk of a confirmed or suspected Ebola disease patient should follow PPE guidance. 11 The expressed milk of a confirmed Ebola disease patient is considered Category A infectious waste and must be disposed of in accordance with CDC guidance on waste management.13\\n\\n\\nClinical care for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed Ebola disease\\nA neonate delivered to a patient with confirmed Ebola disease should be considered as a suspect Ebola patient. The neonate should be immediately separated from the confirmed patient and cared for in an isolation unit for 21 days. Neonates born to patients with confirmed Ebola disease should not breastfeed1415.\\nIf the neonate is healthy and stable, provide routine newborn care and conduct non-invasive screening tests. Decisions to delay invasive screening tests and immunizations should consider the diagnosis of the neonate, maternal conditions (such as Hepatitis B status), and family history. Delay circumcision until the end of the 21-day monitoring period and/or a negative orthoebolavirus RT-PCR result on a blood specimen.\\n Ensure that the patient was screened for other causes of tropical febrile illnesses that could contribute to increased morbidity in the neonate, especially malaria. If the neonate becomes febrile during hospitalization, local causes of fever, including hospital-acquired bacterial infections and viral illnesses other than Ebola disease, should also be considered.\\nIn accordance with CDC guidance on Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients in U.S. Hospitals who are Suspected or Confirmed to have Selected Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, visitors should not be allowed for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed Ebola disease until the neonate is beyond the 21-day monitoring period and determined to be uninfected. Visual observation through a window or use of videoconference technology can be used instead of in-person visitation. \\n\\n\\nClinical care for a neonate born to a patient with suspected Ebola disease\\nA neonate born to a patient with suspected Ebola disease should be considered a suspect Ebola patient until the status of the patient who delivered is determined. The neonate should be immediately separated from the suspect patient and cared for in an isolation unit for 21 days. A patient being evaluated for Ebola disease should not breastfeed until the status of their illness is resolved.\\nIf the patient is negative for Ebola disease, remove the neonate from isolation and provide care using standard hospital protocol. \\nIf the patient is confirmed to have Ebola disease, follow the Clinical Care for a Neonate Born to a Patient with Confirmed Ebola Disease guidance above. \\nIf the patient later develops signs and symptoms consistent with Ebola disease during the 21-day monitoring period, follow the above Clinical Care for a Neonate Born to a Patient with Confirmed Ebola Disease until an orthoebolavirus infection in the neonate is ruled out.11 If the patient tests positive, the 21-day monitoring period for the neonate resets to the date of last contact with the patient. \\nVisitors should not be allowed for a neonate born to a person under evaluation for orthoebolavirus infection until the person's infection status is resolved. Visual observation through a window or use of videoconference technology can be used instead of in-person visitation. \\n\\n\\nClinical care for a neonate born to an asymptomatic person with exposure to an orthoebolavirus\\nMonitor neonates born to an asymptomatic woman who had potential orthoebolavirus exposure while pregnant. The neonate can remain in the same room as the potentially exposed person, unless either becomes symptomatic. If either develop symptoms, they should be separated. \\nMonitor the neonate with twice-daily rectal temperatures and assess for signs of infection and other changes in behavior (e.g., not feeding well, excessive sleepiness, uncontrollable crying). This monitoring period should continue for 21 days after the asymptomatic person's last known exposure to an orthoebolavirus. \\nIf the neonate appears healthy and stable after delivery, provide routine newborn care and conduct non-invasive screening tests. Conduct invasive screening tests and immunizations as long as the patient and neonate remain asymptomatic. Delay circumcision until the end of the 21-day monitoring period. \\nA neonate born to an asymptomatic person with an orthoebolavirus exposure should be allowed visitors in accordance with standard hospital protocol. \\n\\n\\nSpecial considerations for breastfeeding\\nOrthoebolaviruses have been shown to be present in breast milk. Neonates born to patients with confirmed Ebola disease should not breastfeed.1415 Where available, testing breastmilk can help guide decisions about when breastfeeding can safely begin. \\nA patient being evaluated for Ebola disease should not breastfeed until the status of their illness is resolved.16 To establish and maintain breast milk production, the patient may express breast milk. If pumping, the patient should use a single-use disposable pump start kit. This breast pump should remain in the patient's room and must not be used by any other patient.\\nIf the patient is negative for Ebola disease, they can begin breastfeeding the neonate from the breast. \\nIf the patient is confirmed to have Ebola disease, follow the Clinical care for a Neonate Born to a Patient with Confirmed Ebola Disease guidance above.\\nDonor breast milk or Ready to Use Infant Formula (RUIF), if available, may be an acceptable substitute.\\n\\n\\nSpecial considerations for discharge\\nDecisions to discharge the neonate should be made in conjunction with local public health authorities. Discharge may only happen after a 21-day monitoring period with no signs of infection and a negative orthoebolavirus RT-PCR result of a blood specimen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tOn This Page\\t\\n\\n\\nScope of guidance\\nBackground\\nClinical safety\\nClinical care for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed Ebola disease\\nClinical care for a neonate born to a patient with suspected Ebola disease\\nClinical care for a neonate born to an asymptomatic person with exposure to an orthoebolavirus\\nSpecial considerations for breastfeeding\\nSpecial considerations for discharge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 30, 2025\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nSources\\nPrint\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\n\\nSyndicate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Source:\\nNational Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\\n\\nReferencesMupapa K, Mukundu W, Bwaka MA, Kipasa M, De Roo A, Kuvula K, et al.

Mackenzie                    A member of the ring vaccination team vaccinates a man in Bosolo village.            ©Credits Ebola disease24 April 2025Key factsEbola disease is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. Three different viruses are known to cause large Ebola disease outbreaks: Ebola virus, Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus.The average Ebola disease case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks. Early intensive supportive care with rehydration and the treatment of symptoms improves survival.Approved vaccines and treatments are only available for one of the viruses (Ebola virus) and are under development for the others. Outbreak control relies on a package of interventions including intensive supportive care of patients, infection prevention and control, disease surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, safe and dignified burials, vaccination if relevant, and social mobilization.OverviewEbola disease (EBOD) is a rare but severe illness in humans (1). It is often fatal. Ebola disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Orthoebolavirus genus of the filoviridae family (2). Six species of Orthoebolaviruses have been identified to date, with three known to cause large outbreaks:Ebola virus (EBOV) causing Ebola virus disease (EVD)Sudan virus (SUDV) causing Sudan virus disease (SVD)Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) causing Bundibugyo virus disease (BVD). \\xa0Ebola disease first occurred in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks: one outbreak was of Sudan virus disease in Nzara in what is now South Sudan, and the other outbreak was of Ebola virus disease in Yambuku, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.While there are licensed vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD. Candidate products are in development. Early intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival. Seeking early care can be lifesaving. TransmissionIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural hosts of the Orthoebolavirus. The virus can get into the human population when people have close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.People can get infected with the virus from another person by direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with:the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease; andobjects or surfaces that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, feces, vomit) from a person sick with the disease or who has died from the disease.People cannot transmit the disease before they have symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus.Health and care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with Ebola disease. This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of a person who has died can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola disease.SymptomsThe incubation period or interval from infection to onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 21 days.The symptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, malaise, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver functions. It is important for health and care workers to be on the lookout for these symptoms. Despite a perception that bleeding is a common symptom, this is less frequent and can occur later in the disease. Some patients may develop internal and external bleeding, including blood in vomit and faeces, bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. Bleeding at the sites where needles have punctured the skin can also occur. The impact on the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability and aggression.DiagnosisIt can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola disease from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers because symptoms at early stage of the disease are similar. Confirmation that the person has an Orthoebolavirus infection is made using the following diagnostic methods:reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assayantibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)antigen-capture detection testsvirus isolation by cell culture.Samples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. All non-inactivated biological specimens should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported nationally and internationally See Diagnostic testing for Ebola and Marburg diseases.Treatment Over the years, WHO and partners have developed guidance and training that outline how to provide the best possible care for patients and increase their chance of survival, whether or not specific treatments are being used. Called optimized supportive care, this covers the relevant tests to administer, how to manage pain, nutrition and co-infections (such as malaria), and other approaches that put the patient on the best path to recovery.For Ebola virus disease, WHO made strong recommendations for treatment with mAb114 (ansuvimabTM) or REGN-EB3 (InmazebTM) that are both monoclonal antibodies. For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD, there are no approved therapeutics, but candidate products are under development and a CORE protocol for clinical trials is available. VaccinesFor Ebola virus disease: Two vaccines are approved: Ervebo (Merck & Co.) and Zabdeno and Mvabea (Janssen Pharmaceutica). Ervebo vaccine is recommended as part of outbreak response, see SAGE recommendations of July 2024.In case of a confirmed Ebola virus disease outbreak, Ervebo vaccines can be accessed through the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision.For preventive vaccination of health-care and frontline workers, request of Ervebo vaccines can be made through Gavi Preventive Ebola vaccination.For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD:Several candidate vaccines are at different stages of development. As part of outbreak response, a CORE protocol to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccine candidates is available. Prevention and controlCommunity engagement is key to successfully controlling any outbreak. Outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as clinical care, surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, infection prevention and control in health facilities, safe and dignified burials, vaccination (only for Ebola virus disease) and social mobilization. Raising awareness of risk factors and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors:Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat.Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission arising from direct or close contact with infected people, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided. Patients should be isolated in a designated treatment center for early care and to avoid transmission at home. Communities should be well informed, both about the disease itself and how to control the outbreak. This is done best when they are involved in the response and there is open discussion.Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased, identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Ebola disease and monitoring their health for 21 days, separating the healthy from the sick to prevent further spread and providing care to confirmed patients. Maintaining good hygiene and a clean environment are also important.Controlling infection in health-care settingsHealth-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe and dignified burial practices.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola disease should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patients’ blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg diseases. Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Orthoebolavirus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.Care for survivors All survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect, dignity and compassion. WHO does not recommend isolation of recovered patients whose blood has tested negative for Orthoebolavirus. Survivors might suffer from both clinical and psychological sequelae. WHO encourages affected countries to consider the establishment of care programme to alleviate sequelae, support to community reintegration, counselling and biological testing. Orthoebolaviruses are known to persist in immune-privileged sites in some people who have recovered. These sites include the testicles, the inside of the eye and the brain. Relapse-symptomatic illness in the absence of re-infection in someone who has recovered from Ebola disease is rare but has been documented. Reasons for this phenomenon are not yet fully understood.Ebola virus transmission via infected semen has been documented up to fifteen months after clinical recovery. To mitigate the risk of this transmission, a semen testing programme should be implemented to: offer counselling to male survivors and their sexual partners to inform them of the potential risk and support them adhering to safer sex practices (including condom provision and good hand and personal hygiene); offer monthly semen testing until they have had two consecutive negative test results; and after two consecutive negative tests, survivors can safely resume normal sexual practices with minimized risk of virus transmission. In the absence of a semen testing programme, male survivors should follow safer sex practices for 12 months. Orthoebolavirus may persist in the placenta, amniotic fluid and fetus of women infected while pregnant, and in the breast milk of breastfeeding women who are infected with the virus. Survivor care programmes should encompass care for pregnant and breastfeeding women after their recovery.\\xa0\\xa0 WHO responseWHO works with countries to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance and supporting at-risk countries to develop preparedness plans. The following document provides overall guidance for control of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks:  Ebola and Marburg virus disease epidemics: preparedness, alert, control, and evaluationWhen an outbreak is detected, WHO responds by supporting outbreak response, disease detection, community engagement, contact tracing, vaccination, vaccine and treatment trials, case management, laboratory services, infection control, logistics, and training and assistance with safe and dignified burial practices.\\xa0ReferencesInternational Classification of Disease, ICD-11, 2024\\xa0: International Classification of Diseases (ICD)International Committee on Virus Taxonomy, ICTV\\xa0: https://ictv.global/report/chapter/filoviridae/filoviridae/orthoebolavirusRelatedDisease outbreak newsWHO's work on Ebola diseaseNewsPaying tribute to David Nabarro30 July 2025WHO Launches Online Training to Strengthen Filovirus Outbreak Response26 March 2025Groundbreaking Ebola vaccination trial launches today in Uganda3 February 2025Feature storiesDonors making a difference: community engagement to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all28 February 2025Donors making a difference: United against mpox, swift and effective response in action25 September 2024Donors making a difference: Climate change and its impact on health9 November 2022MoreFAQs on Ebola virus diseaseFAQs on Ebola vaccinesEbola virus disease outbreak, Guinea: Multi-country strategic readiness and response planHealth Care Readiness: Ebola clinical managementClinical care for survivors of Ebola virus diseaseTherapeutics for Ebola virus diseasePublications on Ebola virus disease\\xa0Ebola outbreak 2022 - Équateur Province, DRC    RegionsAfricaAmericasEastern MediterraneanEuropeSouth-East AsiaWestern PacificPoliciesCybersecurityEthicsInformation disclosurePermissions and licensingPreventing sexual exploitationTerms of useAbout usCareersFrequently asked questionsLibraryProcurementPublicationsContact usNewslettersReport misconduct         Privacy policy                                   ©                                                        2025                            WHO                           \",\n",

Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.                        Symptoms                    The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.Symptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.\\xa0A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.                        Treatment and prevention                    \\xa0Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.\\xa0In the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the  first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial\\xa0was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC.Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus, and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools. In December 2020, the vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and prequalified by WHO for use in individuals 18 years of age and older (except for pregnant and breastfeeding women) for protection against Ebola virus disease caused by Zaïre Ebola virus.\\xa0In May 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended granting marketing authorization for a 2-component vaccine called Zabdeno-and-Mvabea for individuals 1 year and older.\\xa0The vaccine is delivered in 2 doses: Zabdeno is administered first and Mvabea is given approximately 8 weeks later as a second dose. This prophylactic 2-dose regimen is therefore not suitable for an outbreak response where immediate protection is necessary.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Fact sheets Ebola diseaseQuestions and answers Ebola virus diseaseVaccines for Ebola virus diseaseEmergency situations Mubende district, Uganda, 2022Mbandaka, Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2022North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, October – December 2021North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, February-May 2021N’Zerekore, Guinea, February-June 2021Équateur, Democratic Republic of the Congo, June-November 2020North Kivu/Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo, August 2018 - June 2020Équateur, Democratic Republic of the Congo, May-July 2018Bas-Uélé, Democratic Republic of the Congo, May-July 2017West Africa, 2014-2016Disease outbreak news Latest disease outbreak newsInitiatives and groups International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision: Ebola vaccine stockpilesTraining Learning resources on Ebola diseasesTechnical work Clinical managementDisease outbreaksHealth product policy and standards - vaccine standardizationMedical devices for Ebola outbreakSexual and Reproductive Health and Research (SRH) and EbolaR&D Blueprint  NewsAll →30 July 2025Departmental updatePaying tribute to David Nabarro26 March 2025Departmental updateWHO Launches Online Training to Strengthen Filovirus Outbreak Response3 February 2025News releaseGroundbreaking Ebola vaccination trial launches today in UgandaDemocratic Republic of Congo declares new Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka                                23 April 2022                            Latest publicationsAll →16 July 2025Risk communication and community engagement readiness and response toolkit: ebola diseaseThis toolkit is a comprehensive set of practical tools and resources designed to support country-level risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)...

Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts.                        Symptoms                    The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.Symptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.\\xa0A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.                        Treatment and prevention                    \\xa0Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.\\xa0In the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the  first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial\\xa0was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC.Two monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga) were approved for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2020.\\xa0\\xa0The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus, and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools.

Hawkey            ©Credits Final trial results confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease23 December 2016News releaseGENEVA    Reading time:     An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published today in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year.The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners.\"While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa\\'s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,\" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. The vaccine\\'s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or \"rings\") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called \"herd immunity\"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\"Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured,\" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea.To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.\"This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,\" said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300 000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO’s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called “compassionate use” that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO’s partners are working to compile data to support license applications.The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO’s R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.Notes to editorsThe rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust; the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway,; the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; and Médecins Sans Frontières. The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.Interim results of the trial, published in August 2015rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans.Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus. \\xa0Media Contacts Tarik Jasarevic                        Spokesperson / Media Relations                            WHO                    Telephone:+41227915099Mobile:+41793676214Email:jasarevict@who.intFeature storiesDonors making a difference: community engagement to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all28 February 2025    RegionsAfricaAmericasEastern MediterraneanEuropeSouth-East AsiaWestern PacificPoliciesCybersecurityEthicsInformation disclosurePermissions and licensingPreventing sexual exploitationTerms of useAbout usCareersFrequently asked questionsLibraryProcurementPublicationsContact usNewslettersReport misconduct         Privacy policy                                   ©                                                        2025                            WHO                           ',\n",

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization previously recommended that urgent consideration should be given to evaluating new candidate vaccines in randomised trials among health care and front line workers in high risk areas which are not directly related to a case of Ebola (ie, in areas the outbreak has not reached). As part of these efforts, WHO has been working with several partners to discuss study designs that could help assess the efficacy and effectiveness of available candidate vaccines. In order to determine suitability of Ebola vaccines for clinical studies, WHO reviewed data generated by Ebola vaccine manufacturers on two candidate vaccines: the adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/ MVA-BN) vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson, and the CanSino-Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Ad5-EBOV) vaccine.\\xa0These vaccines were assessed according to a framework developed by the WHO Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee on Ebola Experimental interventions (STAC-EE) in 2015 and previously used to assess other candidate Ebola vaccines. The experts considered a number of criteria to be used in the selection of the vaccine that would be tested in clinical studies and observational studies. As recommended by SAGE in April 2019, proposed studies should be scientifically and epidemiologically justified, and have appropriate approvals including from all relevant African and other regulatory and ethics authorities. Criteria included acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses.The assessment performed is not an endorsement of either vaccine, but is intended to guide stakeholders and national authorities in whose countries clinical trials may be proposed. The final decision whether and when to proceed with any clinical trials is the sole prerogative of national authorities.\\xa0Media Contacts Daniela Bagozzi                        Senior Information Officer                    Mobile:+41796037281Email:bagozzid@who.int RelatedMore about Ebola »   This page links all WHO technical and general information on Ebola Virus Disease.\\xa0FAQ: Compassionate use of investigational vaccine for the Ebola outbreak in DRCRead the Q and ANew Ebola therapeutic treatments\\xa0\\xa0More    RegionsAfricaAmericasEastern MediterraneanEuropeSouth-East AsiaWestern PacificPoliciesCybersecurityEthicsInformation disclosurePermissions and licensingPreventing sexual exploitationTerms of useAbout usCareersFrequently asked questionsLibraryProcurementPublicationsContact usNewslettersReport misconduct         Privacy policy                                   ©                                                        2025                            WHO                           ',\n",

The trial is the first-ever multi drug trial for an Ebola treatment. It will form part of a multi-outbreak, multi-country study that was agreed to by partners under a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.\\xa0“While our focus remains on bringing this outbreak to an end, the launch of the randomized control trial in DRC is an important step towards finally finding an Ebola treatment that will save lives,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Until now, patients have been treated under a compassionate use protocol, with drugs that showed promise and had a good safety profile in laboratory conditions. The giant step DRC is taking now will bring clarity about what works best, and save many lives in years to come. We hope to one day say that the death and suffering from Ebola is behind us.”\\xa0 \\xa0Until now, over 160 patients have been treated with investigational therapeutics under an ethical framework developed by WHO, in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC, called the  Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions\\xa0(MEURI). The MEURI protocol was not designed to evaluate the drugs. Now that protocols for trials are in place, patients will be offered treatments under that framework in the facilities where the trial has started. In others, compassionate use will continue up to the time when they join the randomization. Patients will not be treated noticeably differently from before, though the treatment they receive will be decided by random allocation. The data gathered will become standardized and will be useful for drawing conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the drugs.“Our country is struck with Ebola outbreaks too often, which also means we have unique expertise in combatting it,” said Dr Olly Ilunga, Minister of Health of the DRC.\\xa0 “These trials will contribute to building that knowledge, while we continue to respond on every front to bring the current outbreak to an end.”\\xa0\\xa0In October, WHO convened a meeting of international organizations, United Nations partners, countries at risk of Ebola, drug manufacturers and others to agree on a framework to continue trials in the next Ebola outbreak, whenever and wherever that is. Over time, this will lead to an accumulation of evidence that will help to draw robust conclusions across outbreaks about the currently available drugs, and any new ones that may come along.At the heart of the long term plan and the current trial is always the goal to ensure that patients with Ebola and their communities are treated with respect and fairness. All patients should be provided with the highest level of care and have access to the most promising medications.\\xa0The current trial is coordinated by WHO, and led and sponsored by the DRC’s National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB), in partnership with the DRC Ministry of Health, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) which is part of the United States’ National Institutes of Health, The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and other organizations.The deliberations of the consultation are available  here.Media Contacts Tarik Jasarevic                        Spokesperson / Media Relations                            WHO                    Telephone:+41227915099Mobile:+41793676214Email:jasarevict@who.intNewsPaying tribute to David Nabarro30 July 2025WHO Launches Online Training to Strengthen Filovirus Outbreak Response26 March 2025Groundbreaking Ebola vaccination trial launches today in Uganda3 February 2025Fact sheetsEbola disease24 April 2025Feature storiesDonors making a difference: community engagement to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all28 February 2025    RegionsAfricaAmericasEastern MediterraneanEuropeSouth-East AsiaWestern PacificPoliciesCybersecurityEthicsInformation disclosurePermissions and licensingPreventing sexual exploitationTerms of useAbout usCareersFrequently asked questionsLibraryProcurementPublicationsContact usNewslettersReport misconduct         Privacy policy                                   ©                                                        2025                            WHO                           ',\n",

These will be evaluated in a clinical trial called the Solidarity Against Ebola or Tokomeza Ebola.The arrival of the 1200 doses of candidate vaccines just 79 days after the outbreak was declared on 20 September marks a historical milestone in the global capacity to respond to outbreaks. To start Phase 3 trials in Guinea during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2015,\\xa0it was\\xa07 months from declaration to arrival of vaccines. This was a great achievement and set historical records at the time. That trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the Zaire ebolavirus—the one responsible for the West Africa outbreak and more recently, outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But there are no licensed vaccines against the Sudan ebolavirus species responsible for the current outbreak in Uganda, thus the need for the current trial. “Uganda is showing that life-saving research can be promptly organized in the midst of an outbreak,” said Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Acero, Uganda’s Minister of Health. “We will continue to fight the outbreak using the effective tools we already have, which are rapid surveillance to find cases, contact tracing teams identifying those who have been exposed, health workers providing care to those who are sick with the virus, and engaging the community throughout the response, but having a vaccine for this and future outbreaks is important.”The vaccine is one of the three candidates that were recommended for the trial by an independent WHO expert panel: Sabin\\xa0Vaccine Institute\\'s ChAd3-SUDV. The other two, cAdOx1 biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute/Serum Institute of India and Merck/IAVI\\'s SV-SUDV, will be added to the trial when doses arrive.The trial is led by Uganda’s Makerere University and co-sponsored by the Ministry of Health and WHO. WHO worked with the Ugandan government and researchers to design the protocol for the trial, ensure regulatory and ethical processes were speedy, to train research teams and to install the cold chain that will preserve the vaccines at optimal temperature. “The arrival of candidate vaccines in country less than 100 days since the outbreak was declared is the result of a global effort coordinated by WHO. Every time we work together to assess vaccines quickly, we improve. This has benefits now and into the future,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These aren’t trial runs: these are optimizing the system for the next disease threat.”Achieving this milestone is the result of previous preparation, such as WHO’s research and development blueprint which aligns researchers and others on priority areas of research. The milestone is also the result of investments from the US (including through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), the UK and other governments, and a no-regrets approach, which saw WHO bring together the Government of Uganda, vaccine researchers, manufacturers, funders, regulatory officials, and others. Manufacturers got vaccines into vials in record time, with sufficient doses of the candidate vaccines for the trial and potentially beyond.In an equally speedy and collaborative approach, several partners including CEPI, the Government of Canada, the EU’s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response department, and WHO have allocated funds to facilitate the trial implementation. Other partners are also considering their contributions.“This trial is a significant and promising step towards possible protection against the Sudan ebolavirus with African researchers taking a leading role. It showcases the power of scientific research on our continent and how working in collaboration with international partners we can develop critical tools that will limit the lethal effect of Ebola,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “We have recruited and trained 9 research teams ready to be deployed in the districts where the trial will take place.” Professor Bruce Kirenga, the Principal Investigator for the vaccine trial.\"We hope that through the trial we will provide sufficient information to know how effective one or more of the candidate vaccines are, although it will take time to gather quality data,\" Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the WHO Representative in Uganda. \"We are working hand in hand with all partners involved to ensure that the trial will be delivered to high scientific and ethical standards.\" Since the outbreak was declared, the country has recorded a total of 142 confirmed cases and 55 deaths in nine districts, as of 5 December. Early diagnosis and treatment of cases have been critical in curbing infections, in addition to improved disease surveillance and contact tracing, infection, prevention and control as well as mobilizing communities to support the response.There have been no new Ebola cases reported since 27 November. Contacts of recently confirmed cases will be invited to participate in the trial, which is designed to be implemented using a ring vaccination design.   \\xa0--\\xa0Notes to editor:This is a timeline of key moments in this response.7 June, 2022WHO’s research strategic agenda for filovirus research and monitoring 2021-2031 is published. 20 September, 2022Ministry of Health of Uganda declares the outbreak following laboratory confirmation.

In total there were\\xa0164 cases\\xa0(142 confirmed and\\xa022 probable), 55 confirmed deaths and 87 recovered patients. More than 4000 people who came in contact with confirmed cases were followed up and their health monitored for 21 days. Overall, the case-fatality ratio was 47%. The last patient was released from care on 30 November when the 42-day countdown to the end of the outbreak began.\\xa0Health authorities showed strong political commitment and implemented accelerated public health actions. People in the hot-spot communities of Mubende and Kasanda experienced restricted movements.\\xa0\\xa0“I congratulate Uganda for its robust and comprehensive response which has resulted in today’s victory over Ebola,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General. “Uganda has shown that Ebola can be defeated when the whole system works together, from having an alert system in place, to finding and caring for people affected and their contacts, to gaining the full participation of affected communities in the response. Lessons learned and the systems put in place for this outbreak will protect Ugandans and others in the years ahead.”This Ebola outbreak was caused by the Sudan ebolavirus, one of six species of the Ebola virus against which no therapeutics and vaccines have been approved yet. However, Uganda’s long experience in responding to epidemics allowed the country to rapidly strengthen critical areas of the response and overcome the lack of these key tools.\\xa0“With no vaccines and therapeutics, this was one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks in the past five years, but Uganda stayed the course and continuously fine-tuned its response. Two months ago, it looked as if Ebola would cast a dark shadow over the country well into 2023, as the outbreak reached major cities such as Kampala and Jinja, but this win starts off the year on a note of great hope for Africa,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\\xa0\\xa0Soon after Uganda declared the Sudan ebolavirus outbreak, WHO worked with a large range of partners, including vaccines developers, researchers, donors and the Ugandan health authorities to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials. Three candidate vaccines were identified and over 5000 doses of these arrived in the country with the first batch on 8 December and the last two on 17 December. The speed of this collaboration marks a milestone in the global capacity to respond to rapidly evolving outbreaks and prevent them from becoming larger.\\xa0“While these candidate vaccines were not used during this outbreak, they remain the contribution of Uganda and partners to the fight against Ebola. The next time the Sudan ebolavirus strikes we can reignite the robust cooperation between developers, donors and health authorities and dispatch the candidate vaccines,” said Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO Representative in Uganda.WHO and partners supported Ugandan health authorities from the outset of the outbreak, deploying experts, providing training in contact tracing, testing and patient care, as well as building isolation and treatment centres and providing laboratory testing kits. Due to the joint efforts, the processing time for Ebola samples dropped from a few days to six hours. WHO helped to protect frontline health workers by organizing a steady supply of personal protective equipment. The Organization provided nearly US$ 6.5 million to Uganda’s response and an additional US$ 3 million to support readiness in six neighbouring countries.\\xa0\\xa0Although the outbreak\\xa0in\\xa0Uganda\\xa0has been\\xa0declared over, health authorities are maintaining surveillance and are ready to respond quickly to any flare-ups. A follow-up programme has been put in place to support survivors. Neighbouring countries remain on alert and are encouraged to continue strengthening their capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks.\\xa0Click image to enlargeFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:Natalie RidgardCommunication OfficerWHO Regional Office for AfricaEmail: ridgardn [at] who.int (ridgardn[at]who[dot]int)Tel: +254 11 289 0666Elise Tcheutchoua YonkeuCommunications OfficerWHO UgandaEmail:\\xa0tcheutchouae [at] who.int (tcheutchouae[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0Sakuya OKACommunications ManagerWHO\\xa0Regional Office for AfricaEmail: okas [at] who.int (okas[at]who[dot]int)Tel: +242 06 508 1009Help and servicesCopyrightCareersPrivacy policySitemapContact usGeneral inquiriesReport misconductWHO country officesWHO OfficesWHO Eastern Mediterranean RegionWHO European RegionWHO HeadquartersWHO Region of the AmericasWHO South-East Asia RegionWHO Western Pacific RegionFollow usTwitterFacebookYouTubeRss Feed',\n",

The government-led response has activated\\xa0the Incident Management System in order to control the outbreak. In support of the Ministry of Health-led efforts, CEPI, Gavi and WHO have outlined a plan to accelerate research during the outbreak, to ensure access to investigational doses, and to facilitate scaling up and access to any subsequent licensed vaccine.Vaccination is usually one of the response interventions in such an outbreak, however, there are currently no licensed vaccines (or therapeutics) for Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), though there are several candidate vaccines which appear to be suitable for evaluation in a clinical trial during this outbreak.By embedding research at heart of the outbreak response, we can achieve two goals: to evaluate potentially efficacious candidate vaccines, and to potentially contribute to end this outbreak, and protect populations at risk in the future.The Ministry of Health has designated the Makerere University Lung Institute to conduct vaccine and therapeutics clinical trials. The clinical trial to evaluate candidate vaccines against this ebolavirus is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Health in Uganda and WHO, and involves support from partners. A Principal investigator from Makerere University Lung Institute will lead the vaccine trial.\\xa0WHO, CEPI and Gavi are providing support to ensure that sufficient doses of candidate vaccines are available for the trial and beyond.\\xa0 If sufficient doses can be made available, the aim of the vaccine trial would be to establish how effective the candidate vaccines are in diverse populations. The vaccine developers and funders who will make the candidate vaccines available include the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the US government institutions Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and MSD.Moreover, there are other organisations committed to supporting the overall response, including Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), UNICEF, non-governmental organizations, donors, and regulators including the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF).Goals of the collaborationThe following goals have been identified for the organizations’ efforts; these are likely to evolve in response to the outbreak.In the short term, supporting the Ministry of Health of Uganda’s outbreak response efforts as needed to control SUDV and, under their leadership, support a randomized clinical trial to evaluate one or more candidate vaccines as part of the response to the outbreak.In the mid-term, allocating resources to plan for and to reserve sufficient manufacturing capacity to scale up the production of candidate vaccines (even before they are licensed), potentially by establishing a risk-sharing mechanism. This may also involve manufacture of additional vaccines at risk during the trial to ensure that doses of a vaccine found to be efficacious vaccine can be made available to end the outbreak as quickly as possible.Over the longer term, exploring pathways to ensure that licensed SUDV vaccine(s) are available via the Ebola stockpile, which is enabled and funded by Gavi and managed by UNICEF on behalf of the WHO-coordinated International Coordinating Group (ICG) mechanism on Vaccine Provision, potentially using innovative market shaping mechanisms.\\xa0Furthermore, committing to developing a mechanism to ensure equitable access and funding for SUDV vaccines research, outbreak response and preventive vaccination. Also, to provide support for development and evaluation of next generation vaccines.The signatories commit to be guided by the following principles:\\xa0Leverage organisational strengths towards a common goal: Considering each institutions’ mandate and mission and its expertise, all pledged to increase coordination and support the overarching agreed goals which cut across the remit of any one institutionCountry driven and country engaged: Commit to support the Ministries of Health experiencing the outbreaks and ensure any engagement with the countries is coordinated and aligned with the Ministry of Health and responds to locally identified needsDecision making which is evidence-informed and considers access: Commit to ensure decision making builds on robust scientific assessment of candidate vaccines and considers implications for future equitable access to a licensed vaccineEnd-to-end approach based on access and equity: Achieve development and delivery goals by accelerating research and development, as well as push and pull mechanisms and other innovative financing – with access and equity centred at each stageEfficient resource allocation: Ensure adequate funding and resources are available in a timely manner and aligned with national research and response prioritiesResearch integrity and ethics: Conduct research integrated in the response to outbreaks and in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.Global research and development collaboration in response to Ebola outbreaks \\xa0The actions taken by the Ministry of Health in Uganda and its partners build on past collaboration and experiences responding to Zaire ebolavirus outbreaks (another Ebola virus species), on COVAX lessons learned, and on working on other vaccine stockpile mechanisms.A commitment to encourage availability of doses for the candidate vaccines for clinical trial and beyond. In 2014, the Gavi Board approved a funding envelope for accelerated access to Ebola vaccines including eventual procurement of licensed vaccines, vaccine delivery and support for recovery in affected countries. Gavi subsequently signed an Advance Purchase Commitment (APC) agreement with Merck, securing the commitment to achieve and maintain availability of 300,000 doses of investigational vaccine doses until licensure and WHO recommendation.Integrating clinical research in the outbreak response. Together with the Ministry of Health in Guinea, WHO was part of a broader coalition of countries and partners which worked to assess candidate Ebola vaccines in the context of the West Africa Ebola outbreak caused by Zaire ebolavirus species.\\xa0 In 2014, a WHO-led global consortium rapidly initiated the necessary Phase 1 trials (VEBCON) and a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in Guinea led by the Ministry of Health and WHO with several other partners which generated the evidence on the efficacy of the rVSV- ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. Additional clinical trials to evaluate various vaccines were conducted in 2015 by the Ministries of Health of Liberia and Sierra Leone and with the support of the US National Institutes of Health, The US Centers for Disease Control and the London School of Hygiene and Public Health among others. The experience of the West Africa Ebola outbreak catalysed the establishment of the WHO R&D Blueprint for epidemics by the World Health Assembly in 2015 after CEPI in 2016.Deploying vaccines with proven efficacy yet unlicensed as part of the outbreak response. After 2015 and before its licensure, the proven effective yet unlicensed vaccine was successfully deployed as part of the response to Ebola outbreaks until 2021 under the leadership of the Ministries of health and with support from WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and other partners. In all the outbreaks since 2016 Ministries of Health, WHO, and several partners have also collected additional evidence on the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. Despite the challenges, during the 2018-2020 outbreaks in Equateur, North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, over 320,000 people at risk of Ebola (contacts, contacts of contacts, and health care and front-line workers in affected areas) received a safe and effective vaccine.Creating a mechanism to ensure availability and access to licensed vaccines. In 2019, the Gavi Board approved funding for the establishment of a global stockpile of licensed Ebola vaccines, administered via the ICG mechanism – initially with investigational doses and then licensed vaccine for Ebola Zaire – but with potential to include other vaccines, depending vaccine availability and following WHO recommendations. Stockpile of licensed doses have since been used to combat recent smaller outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea.A global, end-to-end collaboration to promote equitable access in support of countries’ strategies and needs. Beyond Ebola, the lessons from the COVID-19 response, including the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and key learnings from the vaccine pillar COVAX, are particularly important for the field of vaccine R&D, manufacturing, delivery and country and community engagement.\\xa0Notes to editorsAbout CEPICEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, launched in 2017, to develop vaccines against future epidemics. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic threats so they can be accessible to all people in need. Prior to COVID-19, CEPI’s work focused on developing vaccines against Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Chikungunya virus – it has over 20 vaccine candidates against these pathogens in development. CEPI has also invested in new platform technologies for rapid vaccine development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).CEPI has played a central role in the global response to COVID-19, supporting the development of the world’s largest portfolio of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with a focus on speed, scale and access, as well as co-leading COVAX, the global initiative to deliver fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. CEPI is also the world’s leading funder of R&D for broadly protective coronavirus vaccines which could protect against future variants of COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential.CEPI has embarked upon an ambitious US$3.5bn five-year plan – called CEPI 2.0 - to dramatically reduce or even eliminate the future risk of pandemics and epidemics. Central to the plan is CEPI’s goal – supported by the G7 and G20 - to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days. Achieving this ‘100 Days Mission’ would give the world a fighting chance of containing a future outbreak before it spreads to become a global pandemic. Read the plan at endpandemics.cepi.net/About GaviGavi, the Vaccine Alliance is a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world’s children against some of the world’s deadliest diseases. Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has helped to immunise a whole generation – over 981 million children – and prevented more than 16.2 million future deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 73 lower-income countries. Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems as well as funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. After two decades of progress, Gavi is now focused on protecting the next generation, above all the zero-dose children who have not received even a single vaccine shot. The Vaccine Alliance employs innovative finance and the latest technology – from drones to biometrics – to save millions more lives, prevent outbreaks before they can spread and help countries on the road to self-sufficiency. Gavi is a co-convener of COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, together with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. In its role, Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery.The Vaccine Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, technical agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other private sector partners.

The center, which also has nine (9) High Dependency Care beds recently discharged five health workers who had managed successfully and recovered.“I want to appreciate our front liners - the health workers who have dedicated their lives to serve and save the people of Uganda. Your commitment and determination do not go unnoticed and without you, there is no life,” said Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng.With support from WHO and the generous contribution of partners including the Norwegian government, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), the center has trained 30 health workers in the Ebola response. Through WHO support, a WHO case management expert and a senior MoH specialist doctor from Mulago hospital have been deployed to support case management and training at the site.The WHO health organization has also provided discharge kits for the five health workers who were cured, assorted infection prevention and control (IPC) and case management supplies, three (3) monitors, three (3) ventilators, and three (3) defibrillators from funding for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) preparedness in 2018/2019.“We are committed to continuing working with the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Health to ensure that the Ebola outbreak is contained. WHO is supporting all response pillars including case management to make sure that all cases are managed properly,” said Dr. Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the WHO Representative to Uganda.At the Mulago Hospital, the team toured the recently opened isolation unit capable of managing 120 patient at a time. The center is currently used for the isolation of high-risk suspects and other contacts pending confirmation of their test results. The team also visited the site at Mulago that was been earmarked for expansion for additional ETU beds. The construction of the new Site will be done by MSF who have also supported ETU construction in Mubende.WHO has supported the treatment center at Mulago with one standard Viral hemorrhagic Fever kit (VHF PPE) that has supplies and equipment adequate for staff protection, assorted case management, and infection prevention and control supplies for use in the treatment. A 200 kva diesel generator was also supplied to provide power backup at the treatment center.“I appreciate the support received so far from development partners towards the Ebola response. Strong partnerships and collaboration are the cornerstones of any response. I urge you to mobilize more resources to enable us to contain this outbreak,” said Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng.Since the Ebola outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Health on 20 September 2022, the country has so far recorded 64 cumulative confirmed cases and 25 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 39% as of 19 October 2022.Response efforts are ongoing in the country to strengthen case management, contact tracing and community engagement.Click image to enlargeFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:Elise Tcheutchoua YonkeuCommunications OfficerWHO UgandaEmail:\\xa0tcheutchouae [at] who.int (tcheutchouae[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0Help and servicesCopyrightCareersPrivacy policySitemapContact usGeneral inquiriesReport misconductWHO country officesWHO OfficesWHO Eastern Mediterranean RegionWHO European RegionWHO HeadquartersWHO Region of the AmericasWHO South-East Asia RegionWHO Western Pacific RegionFollow usTwitterFacebookYouTubeRss Feed',\n",

The population is mobile due to trade, social and cultural connections. In addition, the country hosts many refugees who continue to keep ties with their countries of origin.Recognizing the importance of collaborative efforts, the Government of Uganda, with support from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and WHO today hosted a High-Level Emergency Ministerial meeting on Cross Border Collaboration for Preparedness and Response to Ebola Disease Outbreaks in Kampala.The meeting concluded with a communique in which Ministers of Health and senior government officials from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda endorsed key measures to prevent the cross-border spread of the Sudan Ebolavirus. These include disease surveillance, contact tracing and monitoring, prompt alert notification, information sharing and joint trainings of emergency responders, as well as carrying out simulation exercises to enhance preparedness and response.“Uganda has experience in managing epidemics and since the beginning of this Ebola outbreak, with the support of our partners, we have taken measures to limit the transmission of the disease. Sharing experience and strengthening collaboration between our countries will enable us to respond quickly and efficiently to health emergencies affecting our countries,” said Hon Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Acero, Uganda’s Minister of Health.Uganda declared an outbreak of the Sudan ebolavirus on 20 September 2022, marking the first time this species – one of the six under the Ebolavirus genus – was detected in the country since 2012.\\xa0“One of the crucial lessons Africa has learnt from previous Ebola outbreaks is that by uniting, we stay a step ahead of the virus. Through sharing information and resources, countries can go from firefighting to building an outbreak firewall and halting the spread of infections,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The joint efforts agreed upon today place Uganda and the region on the road to breaking Ebola’s grip.”The outbreak has affected five districts, and as of 12 October 2022, 54 confirmed cases and 19 deaths have been reported. With the intensifying response, more than a thousand contacts have been identified, while 20 people have recovered from the disease.“We as a continent must work together to plan, prepare and respond to the Ebola outbreak and other public health threats through resource sharing, regional efforts to build resilience capacity of human resources, strengthening laboratory systems, surveillance, treatment and care,” said Dr Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, Acting Director General of the Africa CDC, emphasizing the need for collaboration efforts in ensuring health security of the Eastern Africa region and beyond. He also called for action to support the implementation of the Africa New Public Health Order.The Ministers of Health also agreed on joint plans to carry out cross-border readiness, including raising public awareness and conducting community engagement campaigns. They also agreed to the rapid cross-border deployment of medical personnel to tackle the disease.As no effective vaccine against the Sudan ebolavirus has been licenced yet, Ugandan health authorities have focused on supportive care for confirmed cases alongside stepping up testing, surveillance, infection prevention and control, as well as collaborating with communities to support disease prevention measures.There are at least six candidate vaccines against Sudan ebolavirus, which are in different stages of development. Three of them have Phase1 data (safety and immunogenicity data in humans), and the remaining are in the preclinical evaluation phase.About the Africa Centres for Disease Control and PreventionAfrica CDC is a specialized technical institution of the African Union that strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions and partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks based on data-driven interventions and programs.

Every contact tracer works with a maximum of 10 village health workers, who are volunteers trained in diseases surveillance. Recruited by communities, village health teams help build trust and overcome fears among responders.In addition to the deployment of contact tracers, two hotlines were created for people to report suspected cases. Investigators follow a list of questions meant to assess the need to dispatch an ambulance or a clinical officer. Once a case is confirmed, a case investigation team establishes a list of contacts, depending on where the patient was likely to have been infected and who they may have met afterwards.After contacts have been located and screened, village health teams take over to monitor them for any symptoms for 21 days—the Ebola incubation period. Beyond this important supporting role, these teams also provide invaluable assistance in raising awareness of the disease within their communities. Since the start of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health has trained over 1200 village health team members, also with support from WHO and partners.\\xa0With only 25% of contacts followed every day in the first days of the outbreak, contact tracing quickly improved. By mid-October, nearly 94% of 552 contacts were seen and monitored daily for 21 days.Lydia Nasamba, a market trader and a resident of Madudu, has been a member of a local village health team for more than eight years. “Every day at 3 pm, I go to the sub-county community radio station, where I raise awareness about Ebola, its symptoms, preventive measures and how to report cases,” she says. “After that, I visit the identified contacts in my community to check their health status.”While the contribution of people like Kirrungi and Nasamba was a crucial component of Uganda’s Ebola response, they faced numerous daily challenges, including a lack of personal protective equipment and reliable transport. Contact tracers are often faced with community members’ fear of being stigmatized or isolated in a health facility, which puts people’s livelihood at risk. Contacts may also not be home when contact tracers visit them, which makes it difficult to monitor them on daily basis.\\xa0With further support from the United States Agency for International Development and the Norwegian government, WHO provided four Ebola kits to Mubende Regional Hospital, deployed and repurposed 108 technical staff to assist with case management, risk communication, community engagement and laboratory testing.Back on the ground in Madudu, nothing deterred Kirrungi from the task at hand. “Since I have been involved in the Ebola response, I feel like I am saving lives. I have learned that if all contacts are identified and treated, the disease will disappear,” she says. “That\\'s what motivates me every day.\"Click image to enlargeFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:Elise Tcheutchoua YonkeuCommunications OfficerWHO UgandaEmail:\\xa0tcheutchouae [at] who.int (tcheutchouae[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0Natalie RidgardCommunication OfficerWHO Regional Office for AfricaEmail: ridgardn [at] who.int (ridgardn[at]who[dot]int)Tel: +254 11 289 0666Meenakshi DalalMedia Relations OfficerWHO Regional Office for AfricaEmail:\\xa0dalalm [at] who.int (dalalm[at]who[dot]int)Tel: +254 703 245 761 (WhatsApp)Help and servicesCopyrightCareersPrivacy policySitemapContact usGeneral inquiriesReport misconductWHO country officesWHO OfficesWHO Eastern Mediterranean RegionWHO European RegionWHO HeadquartersWHO Region of the AmericasWHO South-East Asia RegionWHO Western Pacific RegionFollow usTwitterFacebookYouTubeRss Feed',\n",

But the nature of their work puts them at increased risk for deadly infectious diseases such as Ebola, so preventive vaccination is crucial wherever possible,” says Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Along with supporting preparedness efforts, Ebola vaccination also helps strengthen health systems, paving the way for adult vaccination programmes, Sambo adds.“We have leveraged professional associations of physicians, nurses, midwifes and laboratory technicians, as well as of Ebola survivors, along with education and religious bodies and humanitarian partners, to encourage prophylactic vaccination for frontline and health care workers,” says Dr Nanou Yanga Mukadi, Cholera Vaccination Focal Point and EPI Ebola Vaccination Officer.“Planning begins at grassroots level, with support from the intermediate and central levels and from partners, including WHO. One important aspect to highlight is awareness-raising. In addition, in-process and end-of-process monitoring is carried out to ensure that the targets are met,” Mukadi adds.Along with Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau and Uganda have also begun preventive vaccination efforts. WHO urges other countries at high risk to also consider preventive Ebola vaccination.Ebola is a severe and often fatal illness, with death rates of 70% to 90% when untreated. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa devastated communities and health services alike. WHO is encouraging countries to prioritize the use of the vaccine as a powerful public health tool to protect health care workers and other frontline service providers at high risk of exposure.In 2023, WHO made a total of 111 497 doses of the ERVEBO® vaccine from the global stockpile available to high-risk African countries, with the aim of ramping up country preparedness for future outbreaks. WHO also supported the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to plan and coordinate preventive Ebola vaccination activities at operational and strategic levels.Health care worker Kavusa Mwenderwa explains the threat from the Ebola virus: “Ebola is transmitted through contact with an infected patient’s blood or bodily fluids, or even through contact with clothing or bed linen contaminated with bodily fluids. Given the nature of our work, the risk to us as health workers is high.”During early phases of an Ebola virus outbreak, health care workers are often first affected, which can lead to unnecessary deaths, staff shortages, and transmission to other patients.His colleague, Remacle Kasereka Kitutu, 40, agrees: “The importance of getting vaccinated cannot be overemphasized. If we as health workers are vaccinated against Ebola, we can work much more efficiently and effectively, while continuing to take all the recommended precautions to avoid infection.”Click image to enlargeFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:Eugene KabambiCommunications OfficerWHO DRC\\xa0Tel : +243 81 715\\xa0 1697Office : +47 241 39 027Email: kabambie [at] who.int (kabambie[at]who[dot]int)Collins Boakye-AgyemangCommunications and marketing officerTel: + 242 06 520\\xa065 65\\xa0(WhatsApp)Email: boakyeagyemangc [at] who.int (boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)Help and servicesCopyrightCareersPrivacy policySitemapContact usGeneral inquiriesReport misconductWHO country officesWHO OfficesWHO Eastern Mediterranean RegionWHO European RegionWHO HeadquartersWHO Region of the AmericasWHO South-East Asia RegionWHO Western Pacific RegionFollow usTwitterFacebookYouTubeRss Feed\",\n",

After learning that he could still sexually transmit the virus up to 90 days after recovery, he resolved to do everything possible to ensure the safety of his wife.Varney was among more than 11 000 patients infected with the virus during the more than two-year-long outbreak in Liberia. He was also one of 857 survivors enrolled in the subsequent Men’s Health Screening Programme, led by Liberia’s Health Ministry, in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“I wanted to be associated with the programme because I wanted to know what was happening to me. I didn’t want to put my wife and family at risk.” Randall Varney, Ebola survivor\\xa0\\xa0The programme, launched in July 2015 after the third and fourth waves of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia were attributed to sexual transmission, aimed to provide semen testing services and safe sex counselling to male Ebola survivors aged 15 years and older.Initiated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, Liberia became the first country to declare all enrolled men safe in July 2022, following two successive negative tests each. In March 2023, the Ministry of Health officially ended the programme with a closing ceremony attended by Minister of Health Dr Wilhemina Jallah, National Public Health Institute staff, partners, as well as Varney and many of the other enrolled men.“Findings from the programme, and the lessons learned, will not only benefit Liberia, but the world,” says Dr Jallah.“Findings from the programme, and the lessons learned, will not only benefit Liberia, but the world.” Dr Wilhelmina Jallah, Minister of Health, Liberia\\xa0Dr Julius Monday, the health emergencies team lead at WHO’s Liberia country office, explains that given limited pre-existing data, the potential for the virus to persist in survivors was identified as an important research topic early in the epidemic.“This need became even more clear when a Liberian woman tested positive for Ebola infection, and epidemiological investigation found that her only exposure was unprotected vaginal intercourse with a male survivor, whose semen tested positive for Ebola RNA 200 days after he first became symptomatic,” he adds.Despite the deep associated stigma, Varney was eager to enrol. “I wanted to be associated with the programme because I wanted to know what was happening to me. I didn’t want to put my wife and family at risk,” he recalls.Over the six years of the programme, survivors were tested every two weeks. WHO also developed the Ebola Virus Persistence Risk Reduction Behavioural Counselling Protocol to identify barriers to risk reduction, and facilitated a personalized Ebola risk-reduction plan, particularly around condom use and abstinence.In addition, WHO provided the protocols, guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures for the programme, along with supplies for sample collections, packaging and consumables.\\xa0Click image to enlargeFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:Ms Letitia NangwaleCommunications OfficerPhone : (266) 590 17166Email: nangwalel [at] who.int (nangwalel[at]who[dot]int)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Meenakshi DalalMedia Relations OfficerWHO Regional Office for AfricaEmail:\\xa0dalalm [at] who.int (dalalm[at]who[dot]int)Tel: +254 703 245 761 (WhatsApp)Related LinksMaking Africa healthierHelp and servicesCopyrightCareersPrivacy policySitemapContact usGeneral inquiriesReport misconductWHO country officesWHO OfficesWHO Eastern Mediterranean RegionWHO European RegionWHO HeadquartersWHO Region of the AmericasWHO South-East Asia RegionWHO Western Pacific RegionFollow usTwitterFacebookYouTubeRss Feed',\n",

This was the third outbreak in the province since 2018.The Democratic Republic of the Congo had  experienced its fourteenth Ebola outbreaks since 1976, the last outbreak being the sixth since 2018 alone – the most frequent occurrence in the country’s Ebola history. Previous outbreaks in Equateur Province were in 2020 and 2018, with 130 and 54 recorded cases respectively.On 4 July 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of the Ebola outbreak. Due to the robust response by the national authorities this outbreak was brought to an end swiftly with limited transmission of the virus. Crucial lessons have been learned from past outbreaks and they have been applied to devise and deploy an ever more effective Ebola response.WHO and partners are working with communities to encourage people to report any suspected cases and therefore allow for timely testing. WHO continues to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo to strengthen outbreak response to infectious diseases and other public health issues.

In accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus infections) after the burial of the last and only confirmed case.        Description of the situationOn 21 August 2022, the MoH of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an Ebola outbreak following laboratory confirmation via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Ebola virus in a fatal case in Beni health zone, North Kivu province.The case was a 46-year-old woman hospitalized and treated from 23 July to 15 August (23 days) for symptoms that included cough, headache, polyarthralgia (joint pain), and physical asthenia (general fatigue), thought to be related to her known co-morbidities. The patient died in hospital on 15 August 2022. The body was returned to the family and buried in a traditional manner on 16 August prior to receipt of the laboratory results.Samples of blood and oropharyngeal secretions tested positive for Zaire ebolavirus by RT-PCR at the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Beni (INRB) on 15 August and these were confirmed at Rodolphe Mérieux INRB Laboratory in Goma on 16 August. The outbreak was declared by the MoH following EVD confirmation testing and genetic sequencing.No additional confirmed or probable cases have been identified since 16 August. Of the 182 contacts of the case, 172 were identified and monitored for 21 days. The 10 contacts who were not followed up were unable to be reached.Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.Public health responseOverall response:\\xa0The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, conducted response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. National and district emergency management committees were activated to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on outbreak prevention and control interventions.Alerts and testing: During this outbreak, from 21 August to 27 September 2022, a total of 9173 alerts were reported from Beni health zone, and all (100%) were investigated, including 607 (7%) validated as suspected cases of EVD. A total of 682 samples were tested for EVD.Points of entry: A total of 2390 (92%) of 2608 travelers registered at points of entry were screened for EVD, and no alerts were detected.Vaccination: As of 27 September, 550 persons in the affected health zone have been vaccinated against EVD using the ring strategy, targeting contacts and contacts of contact. Frontline health care workers made up the majority of those vaccinated (483).WHO risk assessmentThis latest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 days after the burial of the last and only confirmed case on 16 August 2022. This case is genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu provinces. (For more information on this outbreak, please see the WHO outbreak account related to the 2018-2020 event). The source of this most recent outbreak has not yet been identified.A future outbreak is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country. Ebola virus is enzootic and a resurgence from viral persistence in survivors described in recent epidemics. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; gaps remain in the country's capacity to recover, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the Eastern part of the country have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources.A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors — including community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability — in some specific areas such as North Kivu province can increase the risk for new outbreaks of EVD. Moreover, improved capacities in detection, laboratory confirmation and increased surveillance may explain the increased frequency in detecting EVD outbreaks. Nevertheless, WHO is concerned that ongoing challenges regarding insecurity as well as health system challenges (epidemiological surveillance, IPC programmes and practices in health care settings), coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and other ongoing outbreaks, may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.WHO adviceWHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or non-human primates and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.Continue training and retraining      of health personnel for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD      cases as well as retraining on safe and dignified burials.Reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors. WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for the Ebola virus.Reduce amplification of transmission through health care by strengthening IPC programmes within the health care system.Provide ongoing training of the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices.Build and maintain capacities for logistic support in at-risk areas or countries.Based on the\\xa0current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Further informationThe Democratic Republic of Congo declares the end of 15th Ebola outbreak.

These viruses can cause serious illness that, without treatment, can cause death. Orthoebolaviruses were discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.Healthcare providers:Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola disease, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDCTypesThere are four orthoebolaviruses that cause illness in people:Ebola virus (species Orthoebolavirus zairense) causes Ebola virus disease.Sudan virus (species Orthoebolavirus sudanense) causes Sudan virus disease.Taï Forest virus (species Orthoebolavirus taiense) causes Taï Forest virus disease.Bundibugyo virus (species Orthoebolavirus bundibugyoense) causes Bundibugyo virus disease.Some orthoebolaviruses do not cause illness in people. Reston virus (species Orthoebolavirus restonense) can cause illness in nonhuman primates and pigs. Bombali virus (species Orthoebolavirus bombaliense) was identified in bats, but scientists don\\'t know if it causes illness in animals or people.Signs and symptomsPeople with Ebola disease may experience \"dry\" symptoms early in the course of illness. These symptoms may include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue. As the person becomes sicker, the illness typically progresses to \"wet\" symptoms and may include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding. Keep ReadingSigns and Symptoms of Ebola DiseaseHow long it takes for signs to showSomeone with Ebola disease may start getting sick 2 to 21 days after contact with an orthoebolavirus. However, on average, symptoms begin 8 to 10 days after exposure.Risk factorsHealthcare providers and family members caring for someone with Ebola disease without proper infection control methods have the highest risk of infection. The viruses that cause Ebola disease pose little risk to travelers or the general public.How it spreadsPeople can get Ebola disease through contact with the body fluids of an infected sick or dead person. Rarely, some people can get the disease from contact with an infected animal, like a bat or primate.Keep ReadingHow Ebola Disease SpreadsPreventionWhen living in or traveling to regions where viruses that spread Ebola disease may be present, take steps to protect yourself.Avoid contact with body fluidsAvoid contact with body fluids from people and animals, includingBlood and body fluids, like urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid from people who are sick.Semen from someone who has recovered from Ebola disease, until testing shows that the virus is no longer in the semen.Clothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment, or other items that may have touched an infected person\\'s blood or body fluids.The body of someone who is suspected or confirmed to have had Ebola disease (such as during a funeral or burial practices).Bats, forest antelopes, primates, and blood, fluids, or raw meat from these or unknown animals.Wear protective equipmentWear protective equipment if you come in contact with people who are sick or have died from Ebola disease, their blood and body fluids, or objects covered with their blood or body fluids.Monitor your healthIf you return from an area with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, monitor your health for 21 days. Seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola disease.Ebola VaccineThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ERVEBO® for the prevention of Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only). Vaccination is recommended for U.S. adults 18 years and older who are at potential risk of exposure to the Ebola virus. Ebola Vaccine Product InformationTesting and diagnosisHealthcare providers use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to diagnose Ebola disease. They can also test for orthoebolavirus antibodies.Someone being tested for Ebola disease should be separated from other people in a healthcare facility until results are confirmed.Health Care ProvidersClinical Guidance for Ebola DiseaseTreatmentTwo FDA-approved treatments2 are currently available to treat Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only): Inmazeb™ and Ebanga™.Supportive care:Patients have a much better chance of surviving if they receive: Fluids and electrolytes (body salts) by mouth or into their veins.Medicine to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain.Treatment for other infections, if they occur.On This PageWhat it isTypesSigns and symptomsHow long it takes for signs to showRisk factorsHow it spreadsPreventionTesting and diagnosisTreatmentApr. 23, 2024SourcesPrintShareFacebookLinkedInTwitterSyndicateContent Source:National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)Sources1 In an effort to decrease confusion of genus, species, and virus names, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) changed the genus name Ebolavirus to Orthoebolavirus.

How it spreadsBetween animalsScientists believe African fruit bats are involved in the spread of orthoebolaviruses. These fruit bats may be the source of the virus. Infected animals can spread the virus to other animals through contact with infected body fluids or items contaminated by these fluids. Did you know?\\u200eWhen an infected animal spreads the virus to a person, it is called a spillover event.Between peopleAfter an initial spillover event, the virus can spread from person to person. A person becomes infected when their broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth come in contact with:Blood or body fluids from a person who is sick or has died from Ebola disease. Body fluids include urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and amniotic fluid.Objects contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick or has died from Ebola disease. This can include clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment.Infected animals, like bats, primates, or forest antelopesThese viruses may spread through hunting, handling, or eating infected animals.Semen from a person who recovered from Ebola disease. This can happen through oral, vaginal, or anal sex.There is no evidence that orthoebolaviruses spread through contact with vaginal fluids from someone who has had Ebola disease.Fact\\u200eThere is no evidence that mosquitoes or other insects can spread the viruses that cause Ebola disease.View LargerDownloadEbola spreads between animals and then spills over to people.When transmission is possiblePeople sick with Ebola disease can spread the virus to others when they start having symptoms. Some Ebola survivors still carry the virusAdvances in treatment mean more people are surviving Ebola disease. Sometimes people who survive Ebola disease can spread the virus even after their symptoms go away. This happens when the virus remains in certain parts of the body that are shielded from the immune system. For example, the virus can remain in semen even after someone recovers. Whether the virus is present in these body parts and or for how long varies by survivor.What we're still learningSome people who survive Ebola disease may develop antibodies that can last 10 years or longer. This may provide some protection from the species of orthoebolavirus that made them sick. Scientists don't know if survivors are immune for life, or if they can become infected with a different species of orthoebolavirus.Scientists continue to study the long-term effects of infection. They are learning more about why the virus persists in some survivors so they can give them better treatment and care.On This PageWhat causes itHow it spreadsWhen transmission is possibleWhat we're still learningApril 25, 2024SourcesPrintShareFacebookLinkedInTwitterSyndicateContent Source:National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)EbolaLearn about Ebola disease, caused by an infection with one of a group of viruses, known as ebolaviruses, that are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.View AllFor EveryoneAboutSigns and SymptomsOutbreak HistoryHow It SpreadsHealth Care ProvidersClinical GuidanceClinical FeaturesVaccine Product InformationView AllPublic HealthPublic Health StrategySign up for Email UpdatesContact Us Contact Us Call 800-232-4636Contact CDCAbout CDC About CDC PressroomOrganizationBudget & FundingCareers & JobsPolicies AccessibilityExternal LinksPrivacyWeb PoliciesFOIAOIGNo Fear ActNondiscriminationVulnerability Disclosure PolicyLanguages LanguagesEspañolLanguage AssistanceEspañol繁體中文Tiếng Việt한국어TagalogРусскийالعربيةKreyòl AyisyenFrançaisPolskiPortuguêsItalianoDeutsch日本語فارسیEnglishArchive CDC ArchivePublic Health PublicationsContact Us Contact Us Call 800-232-4636Contact CDCAbout CDC PressroomOrganizationBudget & FundingCareers & JobsAbout CDCPolicies AccessibilityExternal LinksPrivacyWeb PoliciesFOIAOIGNo Fear ActNondiscriminationVulnerability Disclosure PolicyLanguages Languages EspañolLanguage Assistance Español繁體中文Tiếng Việt한국어TagalogРусскийالعربيةKreyòl AyisyenFrançaisPolskiPortuguêsItalianoDeutsch日本語فارسیEnglishArchive CDC ArchivePublic Health PublicationsHHS.govUSA.gov\",\n",

Neonates born to patients with confirmed Ebola disease should not breastfeed. Decisions to discharge the neonate should be made in conjunction with local public health authorities. Scope of guidanceAll available evidence on orthoebolavirus infection in neonates and persistence in breastmilk comes from patients infected with Ebola virus (species Orthoebolavirus zairense) during pregnancy. However, CDC expects this data to be applicable to all orthoebolaviruses that cause disease in people (Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Bundibugyo virus, Taï Forest virus).BackgroundSpontaneous fetal loss is high among patients who become infected during pregnancy123. Neonates born to patients with Ebola disease are often premature. They typically do not survive for more than a few weeks1456, with few published exceptions78. It's unclear whether these neonates die from in utero transmission of orthoebolavirus or from factors contributing to high infant mortality.6The first reported survival of an infant born to a patient infected with Ebola virus occurred in 2015. A 25-year-old previously healthy woman reported onset of symptoms eight days prior to delivery. The patient was treated with favipiravir on day 5 of her illness and died on day 8 (hospital day 5) due to severe vaginal bleeding after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The infant was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola disease survivor, and the antiviral GS-5734. Aside from seizure-like activity, the infant had no other symptoms and was discharged home. Subsequent follow-up demonstrated normal development and growth at 12 months of life.97In 2019, two neonates survived after being born to patients infected with Ebola virus. Both pregnant women died shortly after childbirth. Both the patient and neonate pairs received Ebola virus-specific monoclonal antibody treatment (Inmazeb, Ebanga)8. Inmazeb and Ebanga are now FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of Ebola virus disease due to Ebola virus in adult and pediatric patients.10Given the risk of vertical transmission and the high mortality of neonates infected with Ebola virus (species orthoebolavirus zairense), post-delivery administration of Inmazeb or Ebanga should be strongly considered for all live-born neonates of Ebola virus-positive patients.Clinical safety Healthcare workers caring for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed or suspected Ebola disease should follow worker safety practices, in accordance with the principles of the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Neonatal Resuscitation Program1112. They should also follow guidance at the webpages below:Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients in U.S. Hospitals who are Suspected or Confirmed to have Selected Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF)Guidance for U.S. hospital staff caring for a suspected or confirmed VHF patientPPE: Confirmed Patients and Clinically Unstable Patients Suspected to have VHFGuidance on PPE for management of patients confirmed or suspected with selected VHFInterim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in HospitalsVHF guidance for environmental infection control in U.S. hospitalsHandling VHF-Associated WasteVHF Guidance for hospitals and healthcare personnel guidance on the safe handling of waste. Anyone handling the breast milk of a confirmed or suspected Ebola disease patient should follow PPE guidance. 11 The expressed milk of a confirmed Ebola disease patient is considered Category A infectious waste and must be disposed of in accordance with CDC guidance on waste management.13Clinical care for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed Ebola diseaseA neonate delivered to a patient with confirmed Ebola disease should be considered as a suspect Ebola patient. The neonate should be immediately separated from the confirmed patient and cared for in an isolation unit for 21 days. Neonates born to patients with confirmed Ebola disease should not breastfeed1415.If the neonate is healthy and stable, provide routine newborn care and conduct non-invasive screening tests. Decisions to delay invasive screening tests and immunizations should consider the diagnosis of the neonate, maternal conditions (such as Hepatitis B status), and family history. Delay circumcision until the end of the 21-day monitoring period and/or a negative orthoebolavirus RT-PCR result on a blood specimen. Ensure that the patient was screened for other causes of tropical febrile illnesses that could contribute to increased morbidity in the neonate, especially malaria. If the neonate becomes febrile during hospitalization, local causes of fever, including hospital-acquired bacterial infections and viral illnesses other than Ebola disease, should also be considered.In accordance with CDC guidance on Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients in U.S. Hospitals who are Suspected or Confirmed to have Selected Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, visitors should not be allowed for a neonate born to a patient with confirmed Ebola disease until the neonate is beyond the 21-day monitoring period and determined to be uninfected. Visual observation through a window or use of videoconference technology can be used instead of in-person visitation. Clinical care for a neonate born to a patient with suspected Ebola diseaseA neonate born to a patient with suspected Ebola disease should be considered a suspect Ebola patient until the status of the patient who delivered is determined. The neonate should be immediately separated from the suspect patient and cared for in an isolation unit for 21 days. A patient being evaluated for Ebola disease should not breastfeed until the status of their illness is resolved.If the patient is negative for Ebola disease, remove the neonate from isolation and provide care using standard hospital protocol. If the patient is confirmed to have Ebola disease, follow the Clinical Care for a Neonate Born to a Patient with Confirmed Ebola Disease guidance above. If the patient later develops signs and symptoms consistent with Ebola disease during the 21-day monitoring period, follow the above Clinical Care for a Neonate Born to a Patient with Confirmed Ebola Disease until an orthoebolavirus infection in the neonate is ruled out.11 If the patient tests positive, the 21-day monitoring period for the neonate resets to the date of last contact with the patient. Visitors should not be allowed for a neonate born to a person under evaluation for orthoebolavirus infection until the person's infection status is resolved. Visual observation through a window or use of videoconference technology can be used instead of in-person visitation. Clinical care for a neonate born to an asymptomatic person with exposure to an orthoebolavirusMonitor neonates born to an asymptomatic woman who had potential orthoebolavirus exposure while pregnant. The neonate can remain in the same room as the potentially exposed person, unless either becomes symptomatic. If either develop symptoms, they should be separated. Monitor the neonate with twice-daily rectal temperatures and assess for signs of infection and other changes in behavior (e.g., not feeding well, excessive sleepiness, uncontrollable crying). This monitoring period should continue for 21 days after the asymptomatic person's last known exposure to an orthoebolavirus. If the neonate appears healthy and stable after delivery, provide routine newborn care and conduct non-invasive screening tests. Conduct invasive screening tests and immunizations as long as the patient and neonate remain asymptomatic. Delay circumcision until the end of the 21-day monitoring period. A neonate born to an asymptomatic person with an orthoebolavirus exposure should be allowed visitors in accordance with standard hospital protocol. Special considerations for breastfeedingOrthoebolaviruses have been shown to be present in breast milk. Neonates born to patients with confirmed Ebola disease should not breastfeed.1415 Where available, testing breastmilk can help guide decisions about when breastfeeding can safely begin. A patient being evaluated for Ebola disease should not breastfeed until the status of their illness is resolved.16 To establish and maintain breast milk production, the patient may express breast milk. If pumping, the patient should use a single-use disposable pump start kit. This breast pump should remain in the patient's room and must not be used by any other patient.If the patient is negative for Ebola disease, they can begin breastfeeding the neonate from the breast.

It is important for health and care workers to be on the lookout for these symptoms. Despite a perception that bleeding is a common symptom, this is less frequent and can occur later in the disease.

Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.

The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”.

A total of 117 clusters (or \"rings\") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called \"herd immunity\"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\"Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country.

It will form part of a multi-outbreak, multi-country study that was agreed to by partners under a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.\\xa0“While our focus remains on bringing this outbreak to an end, the launch of the randomized control trial in DRC is an important step towards finally finding an Ebola treatment that will save lives,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Until now, patients have been treated under a compassionate use protocol, with drugs that showed promise and had a good safety profile in laboratory conditions. The giant step DRC is taking now will bring clarity about what works best, and save many lives in years to come. We hope to one day say that the death and suffering from Ebola is behind us.”\\xa0 \\xa0Until now, over 160 patients have been treated with investigational therapeutics under an ethical framework developed by WHO, in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC, called the  Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions\\xa0(MEURI). The MEURI protocol was not designed to evaluate the drugs. Now that protocols for trials are in place, patients will be offered treatments under that framework in the facilities where the trial has started. In others, compassionate use will continue up to the time when they join the randomization. Patients will not be treated noticeably differently from before, though the treatment they receive will be decided by random allocation. The data gathered will become standardized and will be useful for drawing conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the drugs.“Our country is struck with Ebola outbreaks too often, which also means we have unique expertise in combatting it,” said Dr Olly Ilunga, Minister of Health of the DRC.\\xa0 “These trials will contribute to building that knowledge, while we continue to respond on every front to bring the current outbreak to an end.”\\xa0\\xa0In October, WHO convened a meeting of international organizations, United Nations partners, countries at risk of Ebola, drug manufacturers and others to agree on a framework to continue trials in the next Ebola outbreak, whenever and wherever that is. Over time, this will lead to an accumulation of evidence that will help to draw robust conclusions across outbreaks about the currently available drugs, and any new ones that may come along.At the heart of the long term plan and the current trial is always the goal to ensure that patients with Ebola and their communities are treated with respect and fairness. All patients should be provided with the highest level of care and have access to the most promising medications.\\xa0The current trial is coordinated by WHO, and led and sponsored by the DRC’s National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB), in partnership with the DRC Ministry of Health, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) which is part of the United States’ National Institutes of Health, The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and other organizations.The deliberations of the consultation are available  here.', 'language': 'en', 'start_index': 6360}, page_content='promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all28 February 2025    RegionsAfricaAmericasEastern MediterraneanEuropeSouth-East AsiaWestern PacificPoliciesCybersecurityEthicsInformation disclosurePermissions and licensingPreventing sexual exploitationTerms of useAbout usCareersFrequently asked questionsLibraryProcurementPublicationsContact usNewslettersReport misconduct         Privacy policy                                   ©                                                        2025                            WHO'),\n",

Infection occurs through contact with the body fluids (blood, urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, vaginal fluid) of an infected person (sick or dead) or, rarely, an infected animal (like a bat or primate).  Healthcare providers and family members caring for infected individuals without proper infection control are at highest risk.

These include loss of appetite, unexplained bleeding, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.  Other symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, red eyes, skin rash, hiccups, and seizures.
